`DIR <directory name>`: Inspect the contents of the given directory
`FILE <file name>`: Inspect the contents of a given file
`GUESS <category>`: Give a final answer as to which category the repo belongs to, only use once you are confident in your answer.

Give your thoughts, then use a command of your choice in the following manner:
COMMAND: <cmd> <arg>
