I want to write a docker file to place inside this repo that will set up a development environment, install any dependencies and run tests to confirm it works.
Remember, instructions such as `pip install <REPO_NAME>` are NOT helpful. I want to build the project from source.
Using the gathered files, collect and summarise any information that may help me. The gatehred files, which you now have access to are:
- <FILES>
You may use the <TOOLS> tools to reinspect the contents of these files if you wish, but you can not access any files other than these. Once you are done, use the <SUMMARISE_TOOL> to give a summary of the information you found.
