I want to write a docker file to place inside this repo that will set up a development environment, install any dependencies and run tests to confirm it works.
Using the files you have gathered, collect and summarise any information that may help me. The files you selected, and now have access to are:
- <FILES>
You may use the <TOOLS> tools reinspect the contents of these files if you wish, but you can no longer access any files other than these. Once you are done, use the new <SUMMARISE_TOOL>
to give a summary of the information you found.
