Now, posit whether this could be fixed by adjusting the dockerfile, or if there is no way for you to build and test this repository.

Examples of errors that cannot be fixed:
- Tests requiring api keys that you do not have access to
- Errors in files in the repo, such as the requirements file.

You can use the other tools provided (<SEARCH_TOOLS>) to inspect the contraints for the repository if you need any additional information. First plan your next move in one or two sentences, then you will be given access to the tools. When using these tools, remember to give file paths **relative to the root directory of the project**, absolutely do not include `/usr/src/app/<project_name>` when providing file paths to the search tools.
After explaining the cause of the error, use the provided <FIXABLE_TOOL> tool to choose whether you think you are capable of fixing this error by adjusting the dockerfile, or if the repo itself is somehow not buildable.
