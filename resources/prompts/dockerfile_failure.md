now, posit whether this could be fixed by adjusting the dockerfile, or if the repository cannot be built and tested.

Examples of errors that cannot be fixed:
- Tests requiring api keys that you do not have access to
- Errors in files in the repo, such as the requirements file.

After explaining the cause of the error, use the provided <TOOL_NAME> tool to choose whether you think you are capable of fixing this error by adjusting the dockerfile, or if the repo itself is somehow not buildable.
