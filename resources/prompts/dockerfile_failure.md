Now, again in only one or two sentences, posit whether this could be fixed by adjusting the dockerfile, or if there is no way for you to build and test this repository.

Examples of errors that cannot be fixed:
- Tests requiring api keys that you do not have access to
- Errors in files in the repo, such as the requirements file.

After explaining the cause of the error, use the provided <FIXABLE_TOOL> tool to choose whether you think you are capable of fixing this error by adjusting the dockerfile, or if the repo itself is somehow not buildable.
If you already have a fix in mind, use the provided <FIXABLE_TOOL> tool straight away to confirm that you believe the dockerfile is fixable, and proceed to the next step.
Otherwise (only if you **do not** already have an idea for a fix), you can use the other tools provided (<SEARCH_TOOLS>) to inspect the contents of the repository for additional information. When using these tools, remember to give file paths **relative to the root directory of the project**, absolutely do not include `/usr/src/app/<project_name>` when providing file paths to the search tools.
