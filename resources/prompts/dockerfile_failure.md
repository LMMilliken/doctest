Now, posit whether this could be fixed by adjusting the dockerfile, or if there is no way for you to build and test this repository.

Examples of errors that cannot be fixed:
- Tests requiring api keys that you do not have access to
- Errors in files in the repo, such as the requirements file.

You can use the other tools provided (<SEARCH_TOOLS>) to inspect the contrsnts for the repository if you need any additional information. In either case, first plan your action, then you will be given access to the tools.
After explaining the cause of the error, use the provided <FIXABLE_TOOL> tool to choose whether you think you are capable of fixing this error by adjusting the dockerfile, or if the repo itself is somehow not buildable.
Here are the contents of the repository's root directory.
