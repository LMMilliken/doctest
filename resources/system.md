I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
- [1] Has a requirements.txt file
- [2] Installations are on a different page (not in the git repo)
- [3] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
- [4] Has multiple requirements files
- [5] Requirements in a .yaml file (for a conda environment)
- [6] Uses poetry for dependency management (has a poetry.lock file)

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`/`):
