# Automatic evaluation of installation instructions

## Setup/Installation
In order to verify the successful installation of a repository,
a dockerfile is constructed and sent to a virtual machine to be executed. \\
As such, a virtual machine is needed to make use of the code in this repository.
Create an ubuntu machine on virtual box with the following properties:
- MACHINE_NAME = "ub"
- USER_NAME = "machine"
- PWD = "123"
Additionally, docker needs to be installed on the virtual machine, and port forwarding needs to be enabled.
See [this](https://dev.to/developertharun/easy-way-to-ssh-into-virtualbox-machine-any-os-just-x-steps-5d9i) tutorial for instructions.
The host port should be `3022`.
