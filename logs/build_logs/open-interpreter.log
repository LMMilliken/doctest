#8 27.42 # Welcome to Poetry!
#8 27.42 
#8 27.42 This will download and install the latest version of Poetry,
#8 27.42 a dependency and package manager for Python.
#8 27.42 
#8 27.42 It will add the `poetry` command to Poetry's bin directory, located at:
#8 27.42 
#8 27.42 /root/.local/bin
#8 27.42 
#8 27.42 You can uninstall at any time by executing this script with the --uninstall option,
#8 27.42 and these changes will be reverted.

#8 27.42 
#8 27.42 Poetry (1.8.3) is installed now. Great!
#8 27.42 
#8 27.42 To get started you need Poetry's bin directory (/root/.local/bin) in your `PATH`
#8 27.42 environment variable.
#8 27.42 
#8 27.42 Add `export PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"` to your shell configuration file.
#8 27.42 
#8 27.42 Alternatively, you can call Poetry explicitly with `/root/.local/bin/poetry`.
#8 27.42 
#8 27.42 You can test that everything is set up by executing:
#8 27.42 
#8 27.42 `poetry --version`
