Using Conda is recommended for managing the Python environment.\n\n**2. Install Dependencies Before Building:** \n   - Install the following dependencies before building Qlib:\n     ```bash\n     pip install numpy\n     pip install --upgrade cython\n     ```  \n\n**3. Cloning and Installing Qlib from Source:**  \n   - Clone the repository and install Qlib as follows:\n     ```bash\n     git clone https://github.com/microsoft/qlib.git && cd qlib\n     pip install .  # Recommended for development: `pip install -e .[dev]`\n     ```  \n   - Note: Avoid using `python setup.py install` as it may lead to obscured problems.\n\n**4. Running Tests:**  \n   - To ensure code quality and pass tests, users can check their code against CI tools integrated with the repository. Users can format the code using black and check styles with pylint and flake8 by running the respective commands as follows:\n     ```bash\n     pip install black  \n     pip install flake8  \n     pip install pylint  \n     black . -l 120\n     flake8 qlib\n     ```  \n   - For further integration into workflow, pre-commit can be set up to automatically manage code formatting.\n\n**5. Note for Mac Users:**  \n   - If using Mac with M1, users may need to install OpenMP for certain dependencies (e.g., LightGBM) before proceeding with installation.\n\nThese instructions will help ensure that the development environment is correctly set up for the Qlib project and that tests can be run to confirm functionality.",

It is recommended to install SymPy using Anaconda, which includes mpmath and other useful libraries.\n\n2. **GitHub Installation**: To install from the GitHub source:\n   - Clone the repository:\n     ```\n     git clone https://github.com/sympy/sympy.git\n     ```\n   - Navigate into the directory and run:\n     ```\n     pip install .\n     ```\n\n3. **Supported Python Versions**: SymPy officially supports Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and PyPy.\n\n### Testing Instructions\n\n1. To execute all tests, run:\n   ```\n   ./setup.py test\n   ```\n\n2. For specific tests, use:\n   - `bin/test` for running tests\n   - `bin/doctest` for running doctests.\n\n3. The master branch is automatically tested by GitHub Actions, and for pull request testing, use the sympy-bot.\n\n### Verifying Installation\n\nAfter installation, verify that SymPy works by running:\n```python\npython\n>>> from sympy import *\n>>> x = Symbol('x')\n>>> limit(sin(x)/x, x, 0)\n1\n>>> integrate(1/x, x)\nlog(x)\n```",
