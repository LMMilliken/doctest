Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of [supported car makes, models, and model years](docs/CARS.md). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera-based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration](docs/INTEGRATION.md) and [limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://youtu.be/NmBfgOanCyk\" title=\"Video By Greer Viau\"><img src=\"https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/assets/8762862/2f7112ae-f748-4f39-b617-fabd689c3772\"></a></td>\n    <td><a href=\"https://youtu.be/VHKyqZ7t8Gw\" title=\"Video By Logan LeGrand\"><img src=\"https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/assets/8762862/92351544-2833-40d7-9e0b-7ef7ae37ec4c\"></a></td>\n    <td><a href=\"https://youtu.be/SUIZYzxtMQs\" title=\"A drive to Taco Bell\"><img src=\"https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/assets/8762862/05ceefc5-2628-439c-a9b2-89ce77dc6f63\"></a></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nTo start using openpilot in a car\n------\n\nTo use openpilot in a car, you need four things:\n1. **Supported Device:** a comma 3/3X, available at [comma.ai/shop](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).\n2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma 3/3X allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` to install the release version.\n3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 250+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md).\n4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your comma 3/3X to your car.\n\nWe have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup). Note that it's possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it's not plug-and-play.\n\nTo start developing openpilot\n------\n\nopenpilot is developed by [comma](https://comma.ai/) and by users like you. We welcome both pull requests and issues on [GitHub](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot).\n\n* Join the [community Discord](https://discord.comma.ai)\n* Check out [the contributing docs](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* Check out the [openpilot tools](tools/)\n* Read about the [development workflow](docs/WORKFLOW.md)\n* Code documentation lives at https://docs.comma.ai\n* Information about running openpilot lives on the [community wiki](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki)\n\nWant to get paid to work on openpilot? [comma is hiring](https://comma.ai/jobs#open-positions) and offers lots of [bounties](docs/BOUNTIES.md) for external contributors.\n\nSafety and Testing\n----\n\n* openpilot observes [ISO26262](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262) guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md) for more details.\n* openpilot has software-in-the-loop [tests](.github/workflows/selfdrive_tests.yaml) that run on every commit.\n* The code enforcing the safety model lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.\n* panda has software-in-the-loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).\n* Internally, we have a hardware-in-the-loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.\n* panda has additional hardware-in-the-loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).\n* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 comma devices continuously replaying routes.\n\nUser Data and comma Account\n------\n\nBy default, openpilot uploads the driving data to our servers. You can also access your data through [comma connect](https://connect.comma.ai/). We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.\n\nopenpilot is open source software: the user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.\n\nopenpilot logs the road-facing cameras, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.\nThe driver-facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.\n\nBy using openpilot, you agree to [our Privacy Policy](https://comma.ai/privacy).
