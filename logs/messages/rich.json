You can install Poetry using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n   ```\n\n2. **Clone the Repository:**\n   Clone the repository to your local machine. Replace `your-repo-url` with the actual URL of your repository.\n   ```bash\n   git clone your-repo-url\n   cd your-repo-directory\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies with Poetry:**\n   Navigate to the cloned repository directory and install the dependencies using Poetry.\n   ```bash\n   poetry install\n   ```\n\n4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**\n   Activate the virtual environment created by Poetry.\n   ```bash\n   poetry shell\n   ```\n\nThese steps will set up the project environment and install all necessary dependencies.

DO NOT EVER USE `CMD pytest`.\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile."
