This file will specify the Docker container's configuration, including the base image, dependencies installation, and entrypoint.\n\nHere is an example `Dockerfile` that installs dependencies using Poetry:\n\n```dockerfile\n# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub\nFROM python:3.9\n\n# Set the working directory in the container\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy the project's Poetry configuration files to the container\nCOPY poetry.lock pyproject.toml /app/\n\n# Install Poetry\nRUN pip install poetry\n\n# Install the project dependencies\nRUN poetry install\n\n# Copy the rest of the application code to the container\nCOPY . /app\n\n# Set the entrypoint for the Docker container\nENTRYPOINT [\"poetry\", \"run\"]\n```\n\n### Step 2: Build the Docker Image\nBuild the Docker image using the Dockerfile you've created. Run the following command in the root directory of your project:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t your_project_name .\n```\n\n### Step 3: Run the Docker Container\nRun the Docker container from the newly created Docker image. Depending on how you intend to run your application (e.g., REPL, script, or an app), you may need to adjust the ENTRYPOINT or COMMAND in the Dockerfile or specify it at runtime.\n\nFor example, to start a shell environment in the container, you can run:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it your_project_name /bin/bash\n```\n\nOr, if you have a specific script or command you'd like to run, you can specify it using:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it your_project_name your_startup_command_or_script\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you will have set up a Docker container for your project, leveraging Poetry for dependency management."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Now that you have gathered sufficient information about the repository, your new task is write a dockerfile to clone (https://github.com/Textualize/rich.git) and then setup a working environment for the repository.
