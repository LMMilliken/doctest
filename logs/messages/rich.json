What do the error logs mean, and what could be causing the error?\nSome reminders that might be helpful:\n- Once you clone the repository, make sure you are inside the repository directory before you proceed with installation.\n- Dont add any additional arguments to pytest, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN pytest`.\n- Dont try to copy the requirements file from one place to another, that will lead to mistakes.\n- Make sure any files you reference really do exist.
