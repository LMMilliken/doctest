To verify that any cloning and installation succeeds, `RUN` the repo's test suite at the end of the build process.\nHere are some tips for successfully writing a dockerfile:\n- Since the dockerfile will be placed inside the repository, there is no need to clone the repo!\n- To ensure that you dont miss any files important to installing the requirements, make sure to copy the *entirety* of the repo into the container. (`COPY . /app/`)\n- make sure that the tests run during the build process, by using `RUN` when running tests. If the final line uses `CMD` then I will be eaten alive (bad). DO NOT EVER USE `CMD <test command>`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to the test command, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN <test command>`\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile.", "sent": true, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "description": "Given your current knowledge of the repo, provide a dockerfile to this function that clones the repo and sets up the repo, then runs tests", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dockerfile": {"type": "string", "description": "The contents of the dockerfile"}}, "required": ["dockerfile"]}}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_NINMidvV7IWoHRXYx8NAu4Ct", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image\\nFROM python:3.8-slim\\n\\n# Set the working directory in the container\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the entire repository into the container\\nCOPY . /app/\\n\\n# Install system dependencies and Python packages required for the project\\nRUN apt-get update && \\\\\\n    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \\\\\\n    gcc \\\\\\n    wget \\\\\\n    && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt \\\\\\n    && pip install --no-cache-dir -e .\\n\\n# Prepare data for the repository\\nRUN wget https://github.com/chenditc/investment_data/releases/download/2024-08-09/qlib_bin.tar.gz && \\\\\\n    mkdir -p ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data && \\\\\\n    tar -zxvf qlib_bin.tar.gz -C ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --strip-components=1 && \\\\\\n    rm -f qlib_bin.tar.gz\\n\\n# Run the test suite to verify the installation\\nRUN pytest tests/\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_NINMidvV7IWoHRXYx8NAu4Ct", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
