If you are building from source for the purposes of\nNumba development, see :ref:`buildenv` for details on how to create a Numba\ndevelopment environment with conda.\n\nIf you are building Numba from source for other reasons, first follow the\n`llvmlite installation guide <https://llvmlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-guide/install.html>`_.\nOnce that is completed, you can download the latest Numba source code from\n`Github <https://github.com/numba/numba>`_::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/numba/numba.git\n\nSource archives of the latest release can also be found on\n`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/numba/>`_.  In addition to ``llvmlite``, you will also need:\n\n* A C compiler compatible with your Python installation.  If you are using\n  Anaconda, you can use the following conda packages:\n\n  * Linux ``x86_64``: ``gcc_linux-64`` and ``gxx_linux-64``\n  * Linux ``POWER``: ``gcc_linux-ppc64le`` and ``gxx_linux-ppc64le``\n  * Linux ``ARM``: no conda packages, use the system compiler\n  * Mac OSX: ``clang_osx-64`` and ``clangxx_osx-64`` or the system compiler at\n    ``/usr/bin/clang`` (Mojave onwards)\n  * Mac OSX (M1): ``clang_osx-arm64`` and ``clangxx_osx-arm64``\n  * Windows: a version of Visual Studio appropriate for the Python version in\n    use\n\n* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_\n\nThen you can build and install Numba from the top level of the source tree::\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nIf you wish to run the test suite, see the instructions in the\n:ref:`developer documentation <running-tests>`.\n\n.. _numba-source-install-env_vars:\n\nBuild time environment variables and configuration of optional components\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBelow are environment variables that are applicable to altering how Numba would\notherwise build by default along with information on configuration options.\n\n.. envvar:: NUMBA_DISABLE_OPENMP (default: not set)\n\n  To disable compilation of the OpenMP threading backend set this environment\n  variable to a non-empty string when building. If not set (default):\n\n  * For Linux and Windows it is necessary to provide OpenMP C headers and\n    runtime  libraries compatible with the compiler tool chain mentioned above,\n    and for these to be accessible to the compiler via standard flags.\n  * For OSX the conda package ``llvm-openmp`` provides suitable C headers and\n    libraries.

If not set (default) the TBB C\n  headers and libraries must be available at compile time. If building with\n  ``conda build`` this requirement can be met by installing the ``tbb-devel``\n  package. If not building with ``conda build`` the requirement can be met via a\n  system installation of TBB or through the use of the ``TBBROOT`` environment\n  variable to provide the location of the TBB installation.

This can be useful to gather feedback, or to stress your changes\nagainst the :ref:`continuous integration <continuous_integration_testing>`\nplatform.  In this case, please prepend ``[WIP]`` to your pull request's title.\n\n.. _buildenv:\n\nBuild environment\n'''''''''''''''''\n\nNumba has a number of dependencies (mostly `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and\n`llvmlite <https://github.com/numba/llvmlite>`_) with non-trivial build\ninstructions.  Unless you want to build those dependencies yourself, we\nrecommend you use `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ to create a\ndedicated development environment and install precompiled versions of those\ndependencies there. Read more about the Numba dependencies here:\n`numba-source-install-check`.\n\nWhen working with a source checkout of Numba you will also need a development\nbuild of llvmlite. These are available from the ``numba/label/dev`` channel on\n`anaconda.org <https://anaconda.org/numba/llvmlite>`_.\n\nTo create an environment with the required dependencies, noting the use of the \ndouble-colon syntax (``numba/label/dev::llvmlite``) to install the latest\ndevelopment version of the llvmlite library::\n\n   $ conda create -n numbaenv python=3.10 numba/label/dev::llvmlite numpy scipy jinja2 cffi\n\n.. note::\n   This installs an environment based on Python 3.10, but you can of course\n   choose another version supported by Numba.  To test additional features,\n   you may also need to install ``tbb`` and/or ``llvm-openmp``. Check the\n   dependency list above for details.\n\nTo activate the environment for the current shell session::\n\n   $ conda activate numbaenv\n\n.. note::\n   These instructions are for a standard Linux shell.  You may need to\n   adapt them for other platforms.\n\nOnce the environment is activated, you have a dedicated Python with the\nrequired dependencies::\n\n    $ python\n    Python 3.10.3 (main, Mar 28 2022, 04:26:28) [Clang 12.0.0 ] on darwin\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\n    >>> import llvmlite\n    >>> llvmlite.__version__\n    0.39.0dev0+61.gf27ac6f\n\n\nBuilding Numba\n''''''''''''''\n\nFor a convenient development workflow, we recommend you build Numba inside\nits source checkout::\n\n   $ git clone git@github.com:numba/numba.git\n   $ cd numba\n   $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace\n\nThis assumes you have a working C compiler and runtime on your development\nsystem.  You will have to run this command again whenever you modify\nC files inside the Numba source tree.\n\nThe ``build_ext`` command in Numba's setup also accepts the following\narguments:\n\n- ``--noopt``: This disables optimization when compiling Numba's CPython\n  extensions, which makes debugging them much easier. Recommended in\n  conjunction with the standard ``build_ext`` option ``--debug``.\n- ``--werror``: Compiles Numba's CPython extensions with the ``-Werror`` flag.\n- ``--wall``: Compiles Numba's CPython extensions with the ``-Wall`` flag.\n\nNote that Numba's CI and the conda recipe for Linux build with the ``--werror``\nand ``--wall`` flags, so any contributions that change the CPython extensions\nshould be tested with these flags too.\n\n.. _running-tests:\n\nRunning tests\n'''''''''''''\n\nNumba is validated using a test suite comprised of various kind of tests\n(unit tests, functional tests). The test suite is written using the\nstandard :py:mod:`unittest` framework.\n\nThe tests can be executed via ``python -m numba.runtests``.  If you are\nrunning Numba from a source checkout, you can type ``./runtests.py``\nas a shortcut.  Various options are supported to influence test running\nand reporting.  Pass ``-h`` or ``--help`` to get a glimpse at those options.\nExamples:\n\n* to list all available tests::\n\n    $ python -m numba.runtests -l\n\n* to list tests from a specific (sub-)suite::\n\n    $ python -m numba.runtests -l numba.tests.test_usecases\n\n* to run those tests::\n\n    $ python -m numba.runtests numba.tests.test_usecases\n\n* to run all tests in parallel, using multiple sub-processes::\n\n    $ python -m numba.runtests -m\n\n* For a detailed list of all options::\n\n    $ python -m numba.runtests -h\n\nThe numba test suite can take a long time to complete.  When you want to avoid\nthe long wait,  it is useful to focus on the failing tests first with the\nfollowing test runner options:\n\n* The ``--failed-first`` option is added to capture the list of failed tests\n  and to re-execute them first::\n\n    $ python -m numba.runtests --failed-first -m -v -b\n\n* The ``--last-failed`` option is used with ``--failed-first`` to execute\n  the previously failed tests only::\n\n    $ python -m numba.runtests --last-failed -m -v -b\n\nWhen debugging, it is useful to turn on logging.  Numba logs using the\nstandard ``logging`` module.  One can use the standard ways (i.e.\n``logging.basicConfig``) to configure the logging behavior.  To enable logging\nin the test runner, there is a ``--log`` flag for convenience::\n\n    $ python -m numba.runtests --log\n\nTo enable :ref:`runtime type-checking <type_anno_check>`, set the environment\nvariable ``NUMBA_USE_TYPEGUARD=1`` and use `runtests.py` from the source root\ninstead. For example::\n\n    $ NUMBA_USE_TYPEGUARD=1 python runtests.py\n\n\nRunning coverage\n''''''''''''''''\n\nCoverage reports can be produced using `coverage.py\n<https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_. To record coverage\ninfo for the test suite, run::\n\n    coverage run -m numba.runtests <runtests args>\n\nNext, combine coverage files (potentially for multiple runs) with::\n\n    coverage combine\n\nThe combined output can be transformed into various report formats - see the\n`coverage CLI usage reference\n<https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cmd.html#command-line-usage>`_.\nFor example, to produce an HTML report, run::\n\n    coverage html\n\nFollowing this command, the report can be viewed by opening ``htmlcov/index.html``.\n\n\n\"\nuse the tools to either get more information or conclude your task once you are confident."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.\nYou can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.\nYou may use the ['get_file_contents', 'inspect_header'] tools to reinspect the contents of these files if you wish, but you can not access any files other than these.

DO NOT EVER USE `CMD <test command>`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to the test command, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN <test command>`\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile.", "sent": true, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "description": "Given your current knowledge of the repo, provide a dockerfile to this function that clones the repo and sets up the repo, then runs tests", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dockerfile": {"type": "string", "description": "The contents of the dockerfile"}}, "required": ["dockerfile"]}}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_YBlzwj3EmjpRrAzxYfl83KBo", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"FROM continuumio/miniconda3\\n\\n# Set the working directory\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the repository contents into the container\\nCOPY . /app/\\n\\n# Create the conda environment and install the dependencies\\nRUN conda create -n numbaenv python=3.10 numba/label/dev::llvmlite numpy scipy jinja2 cffi && \\\\\\n    conda activate numbaenv\\n\\n# Build Numba inside its source checkout\\nRUN python setup.py build_ext --inplace\\n\\n# Run the test suite\\nRUN python -m numba.runtests\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_YBlzwj3EmjpRrAzxYfl83KBo", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
