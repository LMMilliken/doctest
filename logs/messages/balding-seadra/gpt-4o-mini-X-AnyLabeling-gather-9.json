Install ONNX Runtime as detailed (for CPU or GPU), then clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using the appropriate requirements file. After completing these steps, you can generate resources, set the environment variable, and launch the application with specific arguments to confirm that the setup works.\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_bPdnTj8eLtK6UB1bap98oPy6", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_summary", "content": "ok."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Now that you have gathered sufficient information about the repository, your new task is write a dockerfile that will be placed inside (https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling.git) and will setup a working environment for the repository. To verify that any cloning and installation succeeds, `RUN` the repo's test suite at the end of the build process.\nHere are some tips for successfully writing a dockerfile:\n- Since the dockerfile will be placed inside the repository, there is no need to clone the repo!\n- To ensure that you dont miss any files important to installing the requirements, make sure to copy the *entirety* of the repo into the container. (`COPY . /app/`)\n- make sure that the tests run during the build process, by using `RUN` when running tests. If the final line uses `CMD` then I will be eaten alive (bad). DO NOT EVER USE `CMD <test command>`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to the test command, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN <test command>`\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile.", "sent": true, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "description": "Given your current knowledge of the repo, provide a dockerfile to this function that clones the repo and sets up the repo, then runs tests", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dockerfile": {"type": "string", "description": "The contents of the dockerfile"}}, "required": ["dockerfile"]}}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_UGT7PVPD34L0IynXwAxa4gXM", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"# Use the official miniconda3 base image\\nFROM continuumio/miniconda3\\n\\n# Set the working directory\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the entire project into the container\\nCOPY . /app/\\n\\n# Create a conda environment and install dependencies\\nRUN conda create --name x-anylabeling python=3.9 -y \\\\\\n    && conda activate x-anylabeling \\\\\\n    && pip install onnxruntime \\\\\\n    && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt \\\\\\n    && pip install -c conda-forge pyqt=5.15.9\\n\\n# Generate resources\\nRUN pyrcc5 -o anylabeling/resources/resources.py anylabeling/resources/resources.qrc\\n\\n# Set environment variable\\nRUN echo 'export PYTHONPATH=/app' >> ~/.bashrc\\n\\n# Run tests\\ndRUN python -m unittest discover -s tests -p '*_test.py'\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_UGT7PVPD34L0IynXwAxa4gXM", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
