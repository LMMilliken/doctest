Never call\n   ``lib.conn.*`` directly. For example, do this:\n\n   .. code-block:: python\n\n       with g.lib.transaction() as tx:\n             rows = tx.query('SELECT DISTINCT \"{0}\" FROM \"{1}\" ORDER BY \"{2}\"'\n                             .format(field, model._table, sort_field))\n\n   To fetch Item objects from the database, use lib.items(\u2026) and supply\n   a query as an argument. Resist the urge to write raw SQL for your\n   query. If you must use lower-level queries into the database, do\n   this:\n\n   .. code-block:: python\n\n       with lib.transaction() as tx:\n           rows = tx.query('SELECT \u2026')\n\n   Transaction objects help control concurrent access to the database\n   and assist in debugging conflicting accesses.\n-  Always use the `future\n   imports <http://docs.python.org/library/__future__.html>`__\n   ``print_function``, ``division``, and ``absolute_import``, but *not*\n   ``unicode_literals``. These help keep your code modern and will help\n   in the eventual move to Python 3.\n-  ``str.format()`` should be used instead of the ``%`` operator\n-  Never ``print`` informational messages; use the\n   `logging <http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html>`__ module\n   instead. In particular, we have our own logging shim, so you\u2019ll see\n   ``from beets import logging`` in most files.\n\n   -  The loggers use\n      `str.format <http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.format>`__-style\n      logging instead of ``%``-style, so you can type\n      ``log.debug(\"{0}\", obj)`` to do your formatting.\n\n-  Exception handlers must use ``except A as B:`` instead of\n   ``except A, B:``.\n\n\"\nuse the tools to either get more information or conclude your task once you are confident."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.\nYou can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.\nYou may use the ['get_file_contents', 'inspect_header'] tools to reinspect the contents of these files if you wish, but you can not access any files other than these.
