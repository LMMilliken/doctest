If you are building from source for the purposes of\nNumba development, see :ref:`buildenv` for details on how to create a Numba\ndevelopment environment with conda.\n\nIf you are building Numba from source for other reasons, first follow the\n`llvmlite installation guide <https://llvmlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-guide/install.html>`_.\nOnce that is completed, you can download the latest Numba source code from\n`Github <https://github.com/numba/numba>`_::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/numba/numba.git\n\nSource archives of the latest release can also be found on\n`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/numba/>`_.  In addition to ``llvmlite``, you will also need:\n\n* A C compiler compatible with your Python installation.  If you are using\n  Anaconda, you can use the following conda packages:\n\n  * Linux ``x86_64``: ``gcc_linux-64`` and ``gxx_linux-64``\n  * Linux ``POWER``: ``gcc_linux-ppc64le`` and ``gxx_linux-ppc64le``\n  * Linux ``ARM``: no conda packages, use the system compiler\n  * Mac OSX: ``clang_osx-64`` and ``clangxx_osx-64`` or the system compiler at\n    ``/usr/bin/clang`` (Mojave onwards)\n  * Mac OSX (M1): ``clang_osx-arm64`` and ``clangxx_osx-arm64``\n  * Windows: a version of Visual Studio appropriate for the Python version in\n    use\n\n* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_\n\nThen you can build and install Numba from the top level of the source tree::\n\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nIf you wish to run the test suite, see the instructions in the\n:ref:`developer documentation <running-tests>`.\n\n.. _numba-source-install-env_vars:\n\nBuild time environment variables and configuration of optional components\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBelow are environment variables that are applicable to altering how Numba would\notherwise build by default along with information on configuration options.\n\n.. envvar:: NUMBA_DISABLE_OPENMP (default: not set)\n\n  To disable compilation of the OpenMP threading backend set this environment\n  variable to a non-empty string when building. If not set (default):\n\n  * For Linux and Windows it is necessary to provide OpenMP C headers and\n    runtime  libraries compatible with the compiler tool chain mentioned above,\n    and for these to be accessible to the compiler via standard flags.\n  * For OSX the conda package ``llvm-openmp`` provides suitable C headers and\n    libraries.

If not set (default) the TBB C\n  headers and libraries must be available at compile time. If building with\n  ``conda build`` this requirement can be met by installing the ``tbb-devel``\n  package. If not building with ``conda build`` the requirement can be met via a\n  system installation of TBB or through the use of the ``TBBROOT`` environment\n  variable to provide the location of the TBB installation.
