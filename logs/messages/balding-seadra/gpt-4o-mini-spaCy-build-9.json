What do the error logs mean, and what could be causing the error? You do not need to suggest a fix to the dockerfile yet, just identify the error.\nSome reminders that might be helpful:\n- If you are testing with pytest, make sure the final line is `RUN pytest`\n    - If you are using poetry, then `RUN poetry run pytest`.\n- If you are testing with make, the correct command is likely `make test`, not `make tests`.\n- trying to copy the requirements file from one place to another will often lead to mistakes.
