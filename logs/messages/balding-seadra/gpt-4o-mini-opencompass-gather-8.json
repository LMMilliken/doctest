Now you can start your first evaluation using OpenCompass!\n\n- Your first evaluation with OpenCompass!\n\n  OpenCompass support setting your configs via CLI or a python script. For simple evaluation settings we recommend using CLI, for more complex evaluation, it is suggested using the script way. You can find more example scripts under the configs folder.\n\n  ```bash\n  # CLI\n  opencompass --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen\n\n  # Python scripts\n  opencompass ./configs/eval_chat_demo.py\n  ```\n\n  You can find more script examples under [configs](./configs) folder.\n\n- API evaluation\n\n  OpenCompass, by its design, does not really discriminate between open-source models and API models. You can evaluate both model types in the same way or even in one settings.\n\n  ```bash\n  export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY\"\n  # CLI\n  opencompass --models gpt_4o_2024_05_13 --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen\n\n  # Python scripts\n  opencompass ./configs/eval_api_demo.py\n\n  # You can use o1_mini_2024_09_12/o1_preview_2024_09_12  for o1 models, we set max_completion_tokens=8192 as default.\n  ```\n\n- Accelerated Evaluation\n\n  Additionally, if you want to use an inference backend other than HuggingFace for accelerated evaluation, such as LMDeploy or vLLM, you can do so with the command below. Please ensure that you have installed the necessary packages for the chosen backend and that your model supports accelerated inference with it. For more information, see the documentation on inference acceleration backends [here](docs/en/advanced_guides/accelerator_intro.md). Below is an example using LMDeploy:\n\n  ```bash\n  # CLI\n  opencompass --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen -a lmdeploy\n\n  # Python scripts\n  opencompass ./configs/eval_lmdeploy_demo.py\n  ```\n\n- Supported Models\n\n  OpenCompass has predefined configurations for many models and datasets. You can list all available model and dataset configurations using the [tools](./docs/en/tools.md#list-configs).\n\n  ```bash\n  # List all configurations\n  python tools/list_configs.py\n  # List all configurations related to llama and mmlu\n  python tools/list_configs.py llama mmlu\n  ```\n\n  If the model is not on the list but supported by Huggingface AutoModel class, you can also evaluate it with OpenCompass. You are welcome to contribute to the maintenance of the OpenCompass supported model and dataset lists.\n\n  ```bash\n  opencompass --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen --hf-type chat --hf-path internlm/internlm2_5-1_8b-chat\n  ```\n\n  If you want to use multiple GPUs to evaluate the model in data parallel, you can use `--max-num-worker`.\n\n  ```bash\n  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 opencompass --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen --hf-type chat --hf-path internlm/internlm2_5-1_8b-chat --max-num-worker 2\n  ```\n\n> \\[!TIP\\]\n>\n> `--hf-num-gpus` is used for model parallel(huggingface format), `--max-num-worker` is used for data parallel.\n\n> \\[!TIP\\]\n>\n> configuration with `_ppl` is designed for base model typically.\n> configuration with `_gen` can be used for both base model and chat model.\n\nThrough the command line or configuration files, OpenCompass also supports evaluating APIs or custom models, as well as more diversified evaluation strategies. Please read the [Quick Start](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/quick_start.html) to learn how to run an evaluation task.\n\n<p align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">\ud83d\udd1dBack to top</a></p>\n\n\"\nuse the tools to either get more information or conclude your task once you are confident."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.\nYou can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.\nYou may use the ['get_file_contents', 'inspect_header'] tools to reinspect the contents of these files if you wish, but you can not access any files other than these.

Create a new environment with:\\n   ```bash\\n   conda create --name opencompass python=3.10 -y\\n   conda activate opencompass\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Installation**: Depending on your needs, you can install OpenCompass using pip or by building from the source:\\n   - **Pip Installation**:\\n     ```bash\\n     pip install -U opencompass\\n     ```\\n   - **Install from Source**: If you want the latest features:\\n     ```bash\\n     git clone https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass opencompass\\n     cd opencompass\\n     pip install -e .\\n     ```  \\n3. **Running Tests**: After successful installation and dataset preparation, you can evaluate models using CLI commands or Python scripts.
