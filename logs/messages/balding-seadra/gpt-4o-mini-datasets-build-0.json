What do the error logs mean, and what could be causing the error? You do not need to suggest a fix to the dockerfile yet, just identify the error.\nSome reminders that might be helpful:\n- If you are testing with pytest, make sure the final line is `RUN pytest`\n    - If you are using poetry, then `RUN poetry run pytest`.\n- If you are testing with make, the correct command is likely `make test`, not `make tests`.\n- trying to copy the requirements file from one place to another will often lead to mistakes. Avoid this too\n- Make sure any files that are referenced really do exist. Here are the contents of the repo's root directory, `.` (not including the dockerfile, which you have already been shown):\n('.dvc', 'dir')\n('.dvcignore', 'file')\n('.github', 'dir')\n('.gitignore', 'file')\n('.pre-commit-config.yaml', 'file')\n('.zenodo.json', 'file')\n('ADD_NEW_DATASET.md', 'file')\n('AUTHORS', 'file')\n('CITATION.cff', 'file')\n('CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md', 'file')\n('CONTRIBUTING.md', 'file')\n('LICENSE', 'file')\n('Makefile', 'file')\n('README.md', 'file')\n('SECURITY.md', 'file')\n('additional-tests-requirements.txt', 'file')\n('benchmarks', 'dir')\n('docs', 'dir')\n('dvc.yaml', 'file')\n('notebooks', 'dir')\n('pyproject.toml', 'file')\n('setup.py', 'file')\n('src', 'dir')\n('templates', 'dir')\n('tests', 'dir')\n('utils', 'dir')\n- It could be the case the repository has more than one requirements file, if (AND ONLY IF) you are certain the repository has multiple requirements files, it could be the case that the requirements from multiple files are needed to run tests.\n- If you encounter an error like this: `ERROR: Cannot find command 'git' - do you have 'git' installed and in your PATH?`, then you need to install git like so: `apt install git`\n- If you encounter an error that looks like the one shown below, it could be the case that you need to use a newer python version.\n```\n#9 11.05 ERROR: Cannot install <DEPENDENCY>==<VER_NUM> because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.\n#9 11.05 \n#9 11.05 The conflict is caused by:\n#9 11.05     The user requested <DEPENDENCY>==<VER_NUM>\n#9 11.05     The user requested (constraint) <DEPENDENCY>==<VER_NUM>\n```\n- If you encounter an error such as No module named '<PROJECT_NAME>.xxx' , where the name of the  missing module is also the name of the project you are setting up, then you may need to compile the project before testing.\n    - You can do this after installing the requirements like so: `pip install wheel ; pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .`", "sent": true, "tools": null}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The error logs indicate that the `pip install -e .[dev]` command is failing due to a `ReadTimeoutError`, suggesting that the attempt to connect and download dependencies from `files.pythonhosted.org` timed out.

Prerequisites:\n   - Dependencies:\n     - twine: `pip install twine`\n   - Create an account in (and join the 'datasets' project):\n     - PyPI: https://pypi.org/\n     - Test PyPI: https://test.pypi.org/\n   - Don't break `transformers`: run the `transformers` CI using the `main` branch and make sure it's green.\n     - In `transformers`, use `datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets`\n       Add a step to install `datasets@main` after `save_cache` in .circleci/create_circleci_config.py:\n       ```\n       steps.append({\"run\": {\"name\": \"Install `datasets@main`\", \"command\": 'pip uninstall datasets -y && pip install \"datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets\"'}})\n       ```\n     - and then run the CI\n\n1. Create the release branch from main branch:\n     ```\n     git checkout main\n     git pull upstream main\n     git checkout -b release-VERSION\n     ```\n\n2. Change the version to the release VERSION in:\n   - __init__.py\n   - setup.py\n\n3. Commit these changes, push and create a Pull Request:\n     ```\n     git add -u\n     git commit -m \"Release: VERSION\"\n     git push upstream release-VERSION\n     ```\n   - Go to: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/new/release-VERSION\n   - Create pull request\n\n4. From your local release branch, build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between\n   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).\n   - First, delete any building directories that may exist from previous builds:\n     - build\n     - dist\n   - From the top level directory, build the wheel and the sources:\n       ```\n       python setup.py bdist_wheel\n       python setup.py sdist\n       ```\n   - You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.\n\n5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the test PyPI server:\n     ```\n     twine upload dist/* -r testpypi\n     ```\n   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv/notebook by running:\n     ```\n     pip install huggingface-hub fsspec aiohttp\n     pip install -U tqdm\n     pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi datasets\n     ```\n\n6. Upload the final version to the actual PyPI:\n     ```\n     twine upload dist/* -r pypi\n     ```\n\n7. Make the release on GitHub once everything is looking hunky-dory:\n   - Merge the release Pull Request\n   - Create a new release: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/releases/new\n   - Choose a tag: Introduce the new VERSION as tag, that will be created when you publish the release\n     - Create new tag VERSION on publish\n   - Release title: Introduce the new VERSION as well\n   - Describe the release\n     - Use \"Generate release notes\" button for automatic generation\n   - Publish release\n\n8. Set the dev version\n   - Create the dev-version branch from the main branch:\n       ```\n       git checkout main\n       git pull upstream main\n       git branch -D dev-version\n       git checkout -b dev-version\n       ```\n   - Change the version to X.X.X+1.dev0 (e.g. VERSION=1.18.3 -> 1.18.4.dev0) in:\n     - __init__.py\n     - setup.py\n   - Commit these changes, push and create a Pull Request:\n       ```\n       git add -u\n       git commit -m \"Set dev version\"\n       git push upstream dev-version\n       ```\n     - Go to: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/new/dev-version\n     - Create pull request\n   - Merge the dev version Pull Request\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom setuptools import find_packages, setup\n\n\nREQUIRED_PKGS = [\n    # For file locking\n    \"filelock\",\n    # We use numpy>=1.17 to have np.random.Generator (Dataset shuffling)\n    \"numpy>=1.17\",\n    # Backend and serialization.\n    # Minimum 15.0.0 to be able to cast dictionary types to their underlying types\n    \"pyarrow>=15.0.0\",\n    # For smart caching dataset processing\n    \"dill>=0.3.0,<0.3.9\",  # tmp pin until dill has official support for determinism see https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues/19\n    # For performance gains with apache arrow\n    \"pandas\",\n    # for downloading datasets over HTTPS\n    \"requests>=2.32.2\",\n    # progress bars in download and scripts\n    \"tqdm>=4.66.3\",\n    # for fast hashing\n    \"xxhash\",\n    # for better multiprocessing\n    \"multiprocess\",\n    # to save datasets locally or on any filesystem\n    # minimum 2023.1.0 to support protocol=kwargs in fsspec's `open`, `get_fs_token_paths`, etc.: see https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec/pull/1143\n    \"fsspec[http]>=2023.1.0,<=2024.6.1\",\n    # for data streaming via http\n    \"aiohttp\",\n    # To get datasets from the Datasets Hub on huggingface.co\n    \"huggingface-hub>=0.22.0\",\n    # Utilities from PyPA to e.g., compare versions\n    \"packaging\",\n    # To parse YAML metadata from dataset cards\n    \"pyyaml>=5.1\",\n]\n\nAUDIO_REQUIRE = [\n    \"soundfile>=0.12.1\",\n    \"librosa\",\n    \"soxr>=0.4.0;
