To verify that any cloning and installation succeeds, `RUN` the repo's test suite at the end of the build process.\nHere are some tips for successfully writing a dockerfile:\n- Since the dockerfile will be placed inside the repository, there is no need to clone the repo!\n- To ensure that you dont miss any files important to installing the requirements, make sure to copy the *entirety* of the repo into the container. (`COPY . /app/`)\n- make sure that the tests run during the build process, by using `RUN` when running tests. If the final line uses `CMD` then I will be eaten alive (bad). DO NOT EVER USE `CMD <test command>`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to the test command, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN <test command>`\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile.", "sent": true, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "description": "Given your current knowledge of the repo, provide a dockerfile to this function that clones the repo and sets up the repo, then runs tests", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dockerfile": {"type": "string", "description": "The contents of the dockerfile"}}, "required": ["dockerfile"]}}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_yKXKWOYMEHVSk7Q62icItkhR", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"# Use the official Python image as a base image\\nFROM python:3.10-slim\\n\\n# Set the working directory in the container\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the entire current directory contents into the container at /app\\nCOPY . /app/\\n\\n# Install the dependencies\\nRUN pip install -e .\\n\\n# Run the test suite\\nRUN ./setup.py test\\n\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_yKXKWOYMEHVSk7Q62icItkhR", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
