I want to write a dockerfile to build the Torch-Pruning project.
Your tasks is to search the given repository using the provided tools and collect all files that contain documentation related to environment setup, installing dependencies and running tests.
You musnt try to install the repository using pip. `pip install Torch-Pruning` is NOT what we want to find, this is INCORRECT and IRRELEVANT to building the project from source, which is our goal.
Such content could be found in files with names like "testing", "contributing", "setup", etc. Collecting an irrelevant file could harm future results, so make sure that any file you register is indeed relevant.
To reiterate, a file that makes explicit mention of **how to install the project's dependencies** or how to **run unit tests** is considered relevant. Anything else should be ignored.
Your focus should be on natural langauge documents. DO NOT attempt to read or register python files, for example.
Whenever prompted, first plan your next move concisely in only one or two sentences. After that, you will be prompted again, this time being given access to the tools, which you will then use.
In the case that documentation is offered in multiple languages, only gather documentation for a single language.

Here are the contents of the repository's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) assets
- (dir) examples
- (dir) reproduce
- (dir) tests
- (dir) torch_pruning
- (file) .gitignore

- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) README_CN.md
- (file) practical_structural_pruning.md
- (file) requirements.txt

I want to write a docker file to place inside this repo that will set up a development environment, install any dependencies and run tests to confirm it works.
Remember, instructions such as `pip install Torch-Pruning` are NOT helpful. I want to build the project from source.
Using the gathered files, collect and summarise any information that may help me. The gatehred files, which you now have access to are:

It seems that the "practical_structural_pruning.md" file is also absent, leaving us without direct documentation regarding testing or further setup information for the Torch-Pruning project.

Now that you have gathered sufficient information about the repository, your new task is write a dockerfile that will be placed inside (https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning.git) and will setup a working environment for the repository. To verify that any cloning and installation succeeds, `RUN` the repo's test suite at the end of the build process.
Here are some tips for successfully writing a dockerfile:
- Since the dockerfile will be placed inside the repository, there is no need to clone the repo!
- To ensure that you dont miss any files important to installing the requirements, make sure to copy the *entirety* of the repo into the container. (`COPY . /app/`)
- make sure that the tests run during the build process, by using `RUN` when running tests. If the final line uses `CMD` then I will be eaten alive (bad). DO NOT EVER USE `CMD <test command>`.
    - Dont add any additional arguments to the test command, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.
    - Make sure your final line is `RUN <test command>`

use the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile.

------------------
I am trying to build the following dockerfile for the https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning.git repository. It should install any necessary dependencies and then run tests to confirm that installation succeeded:
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the entire repository into the container
COPY . /app/

# Install dependencies (editable install)
RUN pip install -e .

# Run tests to verify the installation

Attempting to build the project using this dockerfile is resulting in the following error:

```
In one or two sentences only, perform a concise diagnosis of this error. What do the error logs mean, and what could be causing the error? You do not need to suggest a fix to the dockerfile yet, just identify the error.
Some reminders that might be helpful:
- If you are testing with pytest, make sure the final line is `RUN pytest`
    - If you are using poetry, then `RUN poetry run pytest`.
- If you are testing with make, the correct command is likely `make test`, not `make tests`.
- trying to copy the requirements file from one place to another will often lead to mistakes. Avoid this too
- Make sure any files that are referenced really do exist. Here are the contents of the repo's root directory, `.` (not including the dockerfile, which you have already been shown):
('.github', 'dir')
('.gitignore', 'file')
('AUTHORS', 'file')
('LICENSE', 'file')
('README.md', 'file')
('README_CN.md', 'file')
('assets', 'dir')
('examples', 'dir')
('practical_structural_pruning.md', 'file')
('reproduce', 'dir')
('requirements.txt', 'file')
('setup.py', 'file')
('tests', 'dir')
('torch_pruning', 'dir')
- It could be the case the repository has more than one requirements file, if (AND ONLY IF) you are certain the repository has multiple requirements files, it could be the case that the requirements from multiple files are needed to run tests.
- If you encounter an error like this: `ERROR: Cannot find command 'git' - do you have 'git' installed and in your PATH?`, then you need to install git like so: `apt install git`
- If you encounter an error that looks like the one shown below, it could be the case that you need to use a newer python version.
```
#9 11.05 ERROR: Cannot install <DEPENDENCY>==<VER_NUM> because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
#9 11.05 
#9 11.05 The conflict is caused by:
#9 11.05     The user requested <DEPENDENCY>==<VER_NUM>
#9 11.05     The user requested (constraint) <DEPENDENCY>==<VER_NUM>
```
- If you encounter an error such as No module named '<PROJECT_NAME>.xxx' , where the name of the  missing module is also the name of the project you are setting up, then you may need to compile the project before testing.
    - You can do this after installing the requirements like so: `pip install wheel ; pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .`
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The error message indicates that `pytest` is not found during the execution of the `RUN pytest` command, which likely means that it wasn't installed as part of the dependency installation step. This could be caused by missing `pytest` in the `requirements.txt` file or by not having it included in the editable install of the package.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Now, again in only one or two sentences, posit whether this could be fixed by adjusting the dockerfile, or if there is no way for you to build and test this repository.

Examples of errors that cannot be fixed:
- Tests requiring api keys that you do not have access to
- Errors in files in the repo, such as the requirements file.

After explaining the cause of the error, use the provided finished_search tool to indicate that you are capable of fixing this error by adjusting the dockerfile.
If you already have a fix in mind, use the provided finished_search tool straight away to confirm that you believe the dockerfile is fixable, and proceed to the next step. Use the finished_search tool the same way you would any other tool: provide a call to it when you are prompted to use a tool. Do not attempt to use the tool when you are still planning your next move in natural language.
Otherwise (only if you **do not** already have an idea for a fix), you can use the other tools provided (get_directory_contents, get_file_contents, check_presence, finished_search) to inspect the contents of the repository for additional information. When using these tools, remember to give file paths **relative to the root directory of the project**, absolutely do not include `/usr/src/app/<project_name>` when providing file paths to the search tools.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The error can likely be fixed by adjusting the dockerfile to ensure that `pytest` is installed, either by adding it to the requirements or by explicitly installing it. I will proceed to use the finished_search tool to confirm that the dockerfile is fixable. 

```python
finished_search()
```

Now, suggest how to fix this error, then use the provided tool to return a fixed version of the dockerfile.
Recall the tips I gave you earlier:
- If you are testing with pytest, make sure the final line is `RUN pytest`
    - If you are using poetry, then `RUN poetry run pytest`.
- If you are testing with make, the correct command is likely `make test`, not `make tests`.
- trying to copy the requirements file from one place to another will often lead to mistakes. Avoid this too

- It could be the case the repository has more than one requirements file, if (AND ONLY IF) you are certain the repository has multiple requirements files, it could be the case that the requirements from multiple files are needed to run tests.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
To fix the error, we can modify the dockerfile to explicitly install `pytest` before running it. This can be done by adding a line to install `pytest` alongside the other dependencies. Here's the updated version of the dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the entire repository into the container
COPY . /app/

# Install dependencies (editable install) and pytest
RUN pip install -e . && pip install pytest

# Run tests to verify the installation

Now I will use the tool to return this fixed version of the dockerfile.

In one or two sentences only, perform a concise diagnosis of this error. What do the error logs mean, and what could be causing the error? You do not need to suggest a fix to the dockerfile yet, just identify the error.
Some reminders that might be helpful:
- If you are testing with pytest, make sure the final line is `RUN pytest`
    - If you are using poetry, then `RUN poetry run pytest`.
- If you are testing with make, the correct command is likely `make test`, not `make tests`.
- trying to copy the requirements file from one place to another will often lead to mistakes. Avoid this too
- Make sure any files that are referenced really do exist. Here are the contents of the repo's root directory, `.` (not including the dockerfile, which you have already been shown):
('.github', 'dir')
('.gitignore', 'file')
('AUTHORS', 'file')
('LICENSE', 'file')
('README.md', 'file')
('README_CN.md', 'file')
('assets', 'dir')
('examples', 'dir')
('practical_structural_pruning.md', 'file')
('reproduce', 'dir')
('requirements.txt', 'file')
('setup.py', 'file')
('tests', 'dir')
('torch_pruning', 'dir')
- It could be the case the repository has more than one requirements file, if (AND ONLY IF) you are certain the repository has multiple requirements files, it could be the case that the requirements from multiple files are needed to run tests.
- If you encounter an error like this: `ERROR: Cannot find command 'git' - do you have 'git' installed and in your PATH?`, then you need to install git like so: `apt install git`
- If you encounter an error that looks like the one shown below, it could be the case that you need to use a newer python version.
```
#9 11.05 ERROR: Cannot install <DEPENDENCY>==<VER_NUM> because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
#9 11.05 
#9 11.05 The conflict is caused by:
#9 11.05     The user requested <DEPENDENCY>==<VER_NUM>
#9 11.05     The user requested (constraint) <DEPENDENCY>==<VER_NUM>
```
- If you encounter an error such as No module named '<PROJECT_NAME>.xxx' , where the name of the  missing module is also the name of the project you are setting up, then you may need to compile the project before testing.
    - You can do this after installing the requirements like so: `pip install wheel ; pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .`
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The error indicates that the installation process failed due to insufficient disk space on the device, as evidenced by the "No space left on device" message. This could be caused by the Docker environment running out of allocated space during the installation of the required packages.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Now, again in only one or two sentences, posit whether this could be fixed by adjusting the dockerfile, or if there is no way for you to build and test this repository.

Examples of errors that cannot be fixed:
- Tests requiring api keys that you do not have access to
- Errors in files in the repo, such as the requirements file.

After explaining the cause of the error, use the provided finished_search tool to indicate that you are capable of fixing this error by adjusting the dockerfile.
If you already have a fix in mind, use the provided finished_search tool straight away to confirm that you believe the dockerfile is fixable, and proceed to the next step. Use the finished_search tool the same way you would any other tool: provide a call to it when you are prompted to use a tool. Do not attempt to use the tool when you are still planning your next move in natural language.
Otherwise (only if you **do not** already have an idea for a fix), you can use the other tools provided (get_directory_contents, get_file_contents, check_presence, finished_search) to inspect the contents of the repository for additional information. When using these tools, remember to give file paths **relative to the root directory of the project**, absolutely do not include `/usr/src/app/<project_name>` when providing file paths to the search tools.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The error related to insufficient disk space may not be resolvable by adjusting the dockerfile itself, as it is primarily a resource allocation issue with the Docker environment. However, I will still use the finished_search tool to indicate that there might be adjustments available that could help minimize space usage. 

```python
finished_search()
```

Now, use the tool that you planned to use.

Now, suggest how to fix this error, then use the provided tool to return a fixed version of the dockerfile.
Recall the tips I gave you earlier:
- If you are testing with pytest, make sure the final line is `RUN pytest`
    - If you are using poetry, then `RUN poetry run pytest`.
- If you are testing with make, the correct command is likely `make test`, not `make tests`.

To address the disk space issue, we can try to minimize the size of the Docker image by combining the installation commands into a single layer and cleaning up any temporary files after installation. 

Here is the updated version of the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the entire repository into the container
COPY . /app/

# Install dependencies and pytest, then clean up
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -e . && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir pytest

# Run tests to verify the installation
RUN pytest
```

Now, I will use the tool to return this fixed version of the dockerfile.
