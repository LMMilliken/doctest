This will help avoid issues related to downloading large packages like `torch`, as well as provide clearer error messages if any specific installation fails. Specifically, we will first install pip packages, then proceed to run pytest.\n\nHere\u2019s the revised Dockerfile:\n\n```Dockerfile\n# Use the official Python image as a base\nFROM python:3.10\n\n# Set the working directory in the container\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy the entire repository into the container\nCOPY . /app/\n\n# Install conda\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget && \\\n    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && \\\n    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /opt/conda && \\\n    rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n# Add conda to PATH\nENV PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH\n\n# Create a conda environment and install pip packages one by one\nRUN conda create --name opencompass python=3.10 -y && \\\n    /opt/conda/bin/conda run -n opencompass pip install -U pip && \\\n    /opt/conda/bin/conda run -n opencompass pip install -e . --no-deps\n\n# Now install dependencies from requirements.txt in the conda environment\nRUN /opt/conda/bin/conda run -n opencompass pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Run the tests\nRUN /opt/conda/bin/conda run -n opencompass pytest tests/\n```\n\nIn this version, we explicitly call the installation of dependencies from `requirements.txt` after installing the editable package, thus allowing us to better handle larger installations more effectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "", "sent": true, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "description": "Given your current knowledge of the repo, provide a dockerfile to this function that clones the repo and sets up the repo, then runs tests", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dockerfile": {"type": "string", "description": "The contents of the dockerfile"}}, "required": ["dockerfile"]}}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_YaCq5GWGC68RdFJD6WyTvFC1", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"# Use the official Python image as a base\\nFROM python:3.10\\n\\n# Set the working directory in the container\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the entire repository into the container\\nCOPY . /app/\\n\\n# Install conda\\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget && \\\\\\n    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && \\\\\\n    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p /opt/conda && \\\\\\n    rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\\n\\n# Add conda to PATH\\nENV PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH\\n\\n# Create a conda environment and install pip packages one by one\\nRUN conda create --name opencompass python=3.10 -y && \\\\\\n    /opt/conda/bin/conda run -n opencompass pip install -U pip && \\\\\\n    /opt/conda/bin/conda run -n opencompass pip install -e . --no-deps\\n\\n# Now install dependencies from requirements.txt in the conda environment\\nRUN /opt/conda/bin/conda run -n opencompass pip install -r requirements.txt\\n\\n# Run the tests\\nRUN /opt/conda/bin/conda run -n opencompass pytest tests/\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_YaCq5GWGC68RdFJD6WyTvFC1", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
