There are several different avenues for that:\n\n* **Good first issues** - Don't know where to start? Take a look at our\n  [\"good first issue\" label](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/contribute).  Issues with\n  this label are meant for newcomers and *should* contain fewer challenging bits.  If the issue\n  ends up trickier than we assumed, you can start a conversation on the issue page or open up a\n  \"Work in Progress\" PR to ask for help. Developers new to PennyLane can use the [requirements-dev.txt](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/blob/master/requirements-dev.txt) file to install dependencies required for PennyLane code development. Simply run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` from the root of the repository.\n\n* **Documentation**- If you would like to add to our documentation or suggest\n  improvements/changes, let us know or submit a pull request directly. Changes that fix rendering\n  issues, grammar, or a broken code example help us a lot too. Take a look at the\n  [documentation guide](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/guide/documentation.html)\n  for more specifics.\n\n* **Add a new Operator or Template.** Circuit structures crop up in literature faster than we can\nadd them, so we are always looking for help. Take a look at the\n[Contributing operators](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/adding_operators.html)\npage for more information.\n\n* **Develop a PennyLane plugin** - PennyLane is designed to be device and quantum-framework\n  agnostic. Users can switch a circuit's device to any other compatible device with barely any code\n  changes. We would love to support even more devices and quantum frameworks.
