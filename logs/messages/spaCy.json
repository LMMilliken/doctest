This is an environmental issue rather than a problem with the Dockerfile or the repository contents.\n\nResolving this issue involves addressing the disk space constraints in the environment where the Docker build is being executed. This can be achieved by either cleaning up unnecessary files from the environment or increasing the available disk space.\n\nSince the issue is environmental and not related to the Dockerfile or the repository contents, it can be resolved by managing the available disk space during the Docker build.\n\n```python\ncan_be_fixed(true)\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_RfygZ76NJgTk9ZzmoYuTWZui", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "can_be_fixed", "arguments": "{\"fixable\":true}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_RfygZ76NJgTk9ZzmoYuTWZui", "role": "tool", "name": "can_be_fixed", "content": "ok."}]
