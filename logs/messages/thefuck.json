DO NOT EVER USE `CMD pytest`.\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile."}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_foySkFN4LjsrNMCGp6S3Ekhf", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"FROM python:3.8\\n\\n# Set the working directory\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Clone the repository\\nRUN git clone https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck.git .\\n\\n# Install via pip\\nRUN pip install thefuck\\n\\n# Run the test suite\\nRUN pytest\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_foySkFN4LjsrNMCGp6S3Ekhf", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
