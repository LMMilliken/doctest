using `requirements.txt`.\n\n    ```dockerfile\n    # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image\n    FROM python:3.9-slim\n\n    # Set the working directory in the container\n    WORKDIR

the container launches\n    CMD [\"python\", \"thefuck/main.py\"]\n    ```\n\n2. **Build the Docker Image**: Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and the repository, then build the Docker image.\n\n    ```bash\n    docker build -t your-repo-name .\n    ```\n\n3. **Run the Docker Container**: After building the image, you can create and start a container from the image.\n\n    ```bash\n    docker run -it your-repo-name\n    ```\n\nHere\u2019s the summarized process:\n\n1. **Create Dockerfile**: Ensure it includes commands to copy the project directory, and install
