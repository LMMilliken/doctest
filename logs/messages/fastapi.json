You can use `venv` to create one.\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   ```\n\n3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**\n   Activate the virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies.\n   - On macOS and Linux:\n     ```bash\n     source venv/bin/activate\n     ```\n   - On Windows:\n     ```bash\n     .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n\n4. **Install Dependencies:**\n   Install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n5. **(Optional) Install Additional Dependencies for Docs and Tests:**\n   If you need to work on documentation or run tests, you might need to install additional dependencies.\n   - For documentation:\n     ```bash\n     pip install -r requirements-docs.txt\n     ```\n   - For tests:\n     ```bash\n     pip install -r requirements-tests.txt\n     ```\n\n6. **Run the Application:**\n   Navigate to the `fastapi` directory (or the appropriate directory containing the main application script) and run the application.\n   ```bash\n   uvicorn fastapi.main:app --reload\n   ```\n\n### Summary:\n1. `git clone <repository-url> && cd <repository-name>`\n2. `python3 -m venv venv`\n3. `source venv/bin/activate` (or `.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate` on Windows)\n4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n5. (Optional) `pip install -r requirements-docs.txt`\n6.

DO NOT EVER USE `CMD pytest`.\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile."}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_734RSVIGkE95znCOTLvhXvU3", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image\\nFROM python:3.9-slim\\n\\n# Set the working directory in the container\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Clone the repository\\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git \\\\\\n    && git clone https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi.git \\\\\\n    && cd fastapi \\\\\\n    && pip install -r requirements.txt\\n\\n# Install pytest\\nRUN pip install pytest\\n\\n# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app\\nCOPY . /app\\n\\n# Run the test suite\\nRUN cd fastapi && pytest\\n\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_734RSVIGkE95znCOTLvhXvU3", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
