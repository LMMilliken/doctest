Here is an example Dockerfile content:\n\n    ```dockerfile\n    # Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub\n    FROM python:3.9-slim\n\n    # Set the working directory in the container\n    WORKDIR /app\n\n    # Copy the requirements file into the container at /app\n    COPY requirements.txt /app/\n\n    # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt\n    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n    # Copy the rest of the working directory contents into the container at /app\n    COPY . /app\n\n    # Specify the command to run on container start\n    CMD [\"python\", \"your_script.py\"]\n    ```\n\n3. **Build the Docker Image:** Use the Dockerfile to build the Docker image.\n\n    ```bash\n    docker build -t my-fastapi-app .\n    ```\n\n4. **Run the Docker Container:** Run the Docker container from the built image.\n\n    ```bash\n    docker run -p 8000:8000 my-fastapi-app\n    ```\n\nThese steps will create a Docker container that sets up a Python environment, installs your project's dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and runs your FastAPI application.

To verify that any cloning and installation succeeds, `RUN` the repo's test suite at the end of the build process.\nHere are some tips for successfully bulding a dockerfile:\n- Once you clone the repository, make sure you are inside the repository directory before you proceed with installation.\n- If dependencies are managed using poetry, make sure it is installed using `RUN pip install poetry`\n- If tests are run using pytest, make sure to install pytest in case it is not included in the dependencies.\n- make sure you use that the tests run during the build process, by using `RUN` when running tests. if the final line uses `CMD` then I will be eaten alive (bad). DO NOT EVER USE `CMD pytest`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to pytest, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN pytest`.\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile."}]
