DO NOT EVER USE `CMD pytest`.\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile."}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_IfqXkz2HfwMMtMaph8udAANl", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"# Use the official Python image as the base image\\nFROM python:3.8\\n\\n# Set the working directory in the container\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Clone the repository\\nRUN git clone https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter.git\\n\\n# Move into the project directory\\nWORKDIR /app/open-interpreter\\n\\n# Install Poetry\\nRUN pip install poetry\\n\\n# Install the project's dependencies using Poetry\\nRUN poetry install\\n\\n# Run the test suite\\nRUN pytest\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_IfqXkz2HfwMMtMaph8udAANl", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
