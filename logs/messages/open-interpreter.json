Here are the step-by-step instructions to install the dependencies and set up the environment inside a Docker container:\n\n### Step 1: Build the Docker Image\n\nStart by building the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile. The `docker build` command will create an image using the Dockerfile present in the root directory.\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t my_poetry_app .\n```\n\n### Step 2: Run a Docker Container\n\nOnce the Docker image is built, run a container from it. Use the `docker run` command to start a new container.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it my_poetry_app\n```\n\n### Step 3: Install Poetry Inside the Docker Container\n\nIf Poetry is not already installed in the Docker container, you can install it using the following command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n```\n\n### Step 4: Install Dependencies Using Poetry\n\nNavigate to the directory containing the `poetry.lock` file, then install the dependencies using Poetry.\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/repo\npoetry install\n```\n\n### Step 5: Start the Application\n\nFinally, start the application using the appropriate command specified in the README or your documentation.\n\n```bash\npoetry run python your_main_script.py\n```\n\n### Complete Script\n\nHere is a complete script that encompasses all the steps mentioned above:\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Build the Docker Image\ndocker build -t my_poetry_app .\n\n# Step 2: Run a Docker Container\ndocker run -it my_poetry_app\n\n# Step 3: Install Poetry inside the Docker Container (if not already installed)\ncurl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n\n# Step 4: Install Dependencies Using Poetry\ncd /path/to/your/repo\npoetry install\n\n# Step 5: Start the Application\npoetry run python your_main_script.py\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/your/repo` and `your_main_script.py` with the actual paths and script names relevant to your repository."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Now that you have gathered sufficient information about the repository, your new task is write a dockerfile to clone (https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter.git) and then setup a working environment for the repository.

DO NOT EVER USE `CMD pytest`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to pytest, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN pytest`.\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile."}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_hHiBHSVit0e3afhbguWbh347", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"FROM python:3.9-slim\\n\\n# Install necessary system packages\\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\\\\n    git \\\\\\n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\\n\\n# Clone the repository\\nRUN git clone https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter.git\\n\\n# Set working directory\\nWORKDIR /open-interpreter\\n\\n# Install Poetry\\nRUN pip install poetry\\n\\n# Install dependencies\\nRUN poetry install\\n\\n# Install pytest\\nRUN pip install pytest\\n\\n# Run the tests\\nRUN pytest\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_hHiBHSVit0e3afhbguWbh347", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Attempting to build the project using this dockerfile is resulting in the following error:\n```\n------\n\n > [8/8] RUN pytest:\n\n0.604 /usr/local/lib/python3.9/importlib/__init__.py:127: in import_module\n\n0.604     return _bootstrap._gcd_import(name[level:], package, level)\n\n0.604 tests/test_interpreter.py:9: in <module>\n\n0.604     from interpreter import AsyncInterpreter, OpenInterpreter\n\n0.604 E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'interpreter'\n\n0.604 =========================== short test summary info ============================\n\n0.604 ERROR tests/core/computer/files/test_files.py\n\n0.604 ERROR tests/test_interpreter.py\n\n0.604 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
