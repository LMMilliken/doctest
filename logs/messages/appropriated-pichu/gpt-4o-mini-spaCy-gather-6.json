(`COPY . /app/`)\n- make sure that the tests run during the build process, by using `RUN` when running tests. If the final line uses `CMD` then I will be eaten alive (bad). DO NOT EVER USE `CMD <test command>`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to the test command, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN <test command>`\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile.", "sent": true, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "description": "Given your current knowledge of the repo, provide a dockerfile to this function that clones the repo and sets up the repo, then runs tests", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dockerfile": {"type": "string", "description": "The contents of the dockerfile"}}, "required": ["dockerfile"]}}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_sLCCrb2zOPKH0VOdLwx3xF3Q", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"# Use the official Python image as a base.\\nFROM python:3.8\\n\\n# Set the working directory.\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the entire repository into the container.\\nCOPY . /app/\\n\\n# Install system dependencies.\\nRUN apt-get update && \\\\\\n    apt-get install -y build-essential python-dev git && \\\\\\n    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\\n\\n# Create and activate a virtual environment.\\nRUN python -m venv .env && \\\\\\n    . .env/bin/activate && \\\\\\n    python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel\\n\\n# Install the python dependencies from requirements.txt.\\nRUN . .env/bin/activate && \\\\\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\\n\\n# Run the test suite to verify the installation.\\nRUN . .env/bin/activate && \\\\\\n    pytest --pyargs spacy -x\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_sLCCrb2zOPKH0VOdLwx3xF3Q", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
