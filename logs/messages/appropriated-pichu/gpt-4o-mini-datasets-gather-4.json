Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) by clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account.\n\n2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone git@github.com:<your Github handle>/datasets.git\n    cd datasets\n    git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/datasets.git\n    ```\n\n3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes:\n\n    ```bash\n    git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n    ```\n\n    **do not** work on the `main` branch.\n\n4. Set up a development environment by running the following command in a virtual environment:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -e \".[dev]\"\n    ```\n\n   (If datasets was already installed in the virtual environment, remove\n   it with `pip uninstall datasets` before reinstalling it in editable\n   mode with the `-e` flag.)\n\n5. Develop the features on your branch.\n\n6. Format your code. Run `black` and `ruff` so that your newly added files look nice with the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    make style\n    ```\n   \n7. _(Optional)_ You can also use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to format your code automatically each time run `git commit`, instead of running `make style` manually. \nTo do this, install `pre-commit` via `pip install pre-commit` and then run `pre-commit install` in the project's root directory to set up the hooks.\nNote that if any files were formatted by `pre-commit` hooks during committing, you have to run `git commit` again .\n\n\n8. Once you're happy with your contribution, add your changed files and make a commit to record your changes locally:\n\n    ```bash\n    git add -u\n    git commit\n    ```\n\n    It is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original\n    repository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:\n\n    ```bash\n    git fetch upstream\n    git rebase upstream/main\n    ```\n\n9. Once you are satisfied, push the changes to your fork repo using:\n\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n   ```\n\n   Go the webpage of your fork on GitHub.

Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) by clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account.\n\n2.

Create a new branch to hold your development changes:\n\n    ```bash\n    git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n    ```\n\n    **do not** work on the `main` branch.\n\n4. Set up a development environment by running the following command in a virtual environment:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -e \".[dev]\"\n    ```\n\n   (If datasets was already installed in the virtual environment, remove\n   it with `pip uninstall datasets` before reinstalling it in editable\n   mode with the `-e` flag.)\n\n5. Develop the features on your branch.\n\n6. Format your code. Run `black` and `ruff` so that your newly added files look nice with the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    make style\n    ```\n   \n7. _(Optional)_ You can also use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to format your code automatically each time run `git commit`, instead of running `make style` manually. \nTo do this, install `pre-commit` via `pip install pre-commit` and then run `pre-commit install` in the project's root directory to set up the hooks.\nNote that if any files were formatted by `pre-commit` hooks during committing, you have to run `git commit` again .\n\n\n8. Once you're happy with your contribution, add your changed files and make a commit to record your changes locally:\n\n    ```bash\n    git add -u\n    git commit\n    ```\n\n    It is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original\n    repository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:\n\n    ```bash\n    git fetch upstream\n    git rebase upstream/main\n    ```\n\n9. Once you are satisfied, push the changes to your fork repo using:\n\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n   ```\n\n   Go the webpage of your fork on GitHub.

To verify that any cloning and installation succeeds, `RUN` the repo's test suite at the end of the build process.\nHere are some tips for successfully writing a dockerfile:\n- Since the dockerfile will be placed inside the repository, there is no need to clone the repo!\n- To ensure that you dont miss any files important to installing the requirements, make sure to copy the *entirety* of the repo into the container. (`COPY . /app/`)\n- make sure that the tests run during the build process, by using `RUN` when running tests. If the final line uses `CMD` then I will be eaten alive (bad). DO NOT EVER USE `CMD <test command>`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to the test command, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN <test command>`\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile.", "sent": true, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "description": "Given your current knowledge of the repo, provide a dockerfile to this function that clones the repo and sets up the repo, then runs tests", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dockerfile": {"type": "string", "description": "The contents of the dockerfile"}}, "required": ["dockerfile"]}}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_vdiNIgEqXNJq9zyhUhOg1gZt", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image\\nFROM python:3.9-slim\\n\\n# Set the working directory in the container\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the entire repository into the container\\nCOPY . /app/\\n\\n# Install required packages with pip\\nRUN pip install -e \\\".[dev]\\\"\\n\\n# Alternatively, install with conda (uncomment if needed)\\n# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y conda\\n# RUN conda install -c huggingface -c conda-forge datasets\\n\\n# Run the test suite to verify the installation\\nRUN pytest\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_vdiNIgEqXNJq9zyhUhOg1gZt", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
