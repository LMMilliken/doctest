The configuration file is organized in Python format and must include the `datasets` and `models` fields.\n\nThe test configuration for this time is [configs/eval_demo.py](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/blob/main/configs/eval_demo.py). This configuration introduces the required dataset and model configurations through the [inheritance mechanism](../user_guides/config.md#inheritance-mechanism) and combines the `datasets` and `models` fields in the required format.\n\n```python\nfrom mmengine.config import read_base\n\nwith read_base():\n    from .datasets.siqa.siqa_gen import siqa_datasets\n    from .datasets.winograd.winograd_ppl import winograd_datasets\n    from .models.opt.hf_opt_125m import opt125m\n    from .models.opt.hf_opt_350m import opt350m\n\ndatasets = [*siqa_datasets, *winograd_datasets]\nmodels = [opt125m, opt350m]\n```\n\nWhen running tasks, we just need to pass the path of the configuration file to `run.py`:\n\n```bash\npython run.py configs/eval_demo.py\n```\n\n:::{dropdown} More about `models`\n:animate: fade-in-slide-down\n\nOpenCompass provides a series of pre-defined model configurations under `configs/models`. Below is the configuration snippet related to [opt-350m](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/blob/main/configs/models/opt/hf_opt_350m.py) (`configs/models/opt/hf_opt_350m.py`):\n\n```python\n# Evaluate models supported by HuggingFace's `AutoModelForCausalLM` using `HuggingFaceBaseModel`\nfrom opencompass.models import HuggingFaceBaseModel\n\nmodels = [\n    # OPT-350M\n    dict(\n        type=HuggingFaceBaseModel,\n        # Initialization parameters for `HuggingFaceBaseModel`\n        path='facebook/opt-350m',\n        # Below are common parameters for all models, not specific to HuggingFaceBaseModel\n        abbr='opt-350m-hf',         # Model abbreviation\n        max_out_len=1024,           # Maximum number of generated tokens\n        batch_size=32,              # Batch size\n        run_cfg=dict(num_gpus=1),   # The required GPU numbers for this model\n    )\n]\n```\n\nWhen using configurations, we can specify the relevant files through the command-line argument ` --models` or import the model configurations into the  `models` list in the configuration file using the inheritance mechanism.\n\n```{seealso}\nMore information about model configuration can be found in [Prepare Models](../user_guides/models.md).\n```\n:::\n\n:::{dropdown} More about `datasets`\n:animate: fade-in-slide-down\n\nSimilar to models, dataset configuration files are provided under `configs/datasets`. Users can use `--datasets` in the command line or import related configurations in the configuration file via inheritance\n\nBelow is a dataset-related configuration snippet from `configs/eval_demo.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom mmengine.config import read_base  # Use mmengine.read_base() to read the base configuration\n\nwith read_base():\n    # Directly read the required dataset configurations from the preset dataset configurations\n    from .datasets.winograd.winograd_ppl import winograd_datasets  # Read Winograd configuration, evaluated based on PPL (perplexity)\n    from .datasets.siqa.siqa_gen import siqa_datasets  # Read SIQA configuration, evaluated based on generation\n\ndatasets = [*siqa_datasets, *winograd_datasets]       # The final config needs to contain the required evaluation dataset list 'datasets'\n```\n\nDataset configurations are typically of two types: 'ppl' and 'gen', indicating the evaluation method used. Where `ppl` means discriminative evaluation and `gen` means generative evaluation.\n\nMoreover, [configs/datasets/collections](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/blob/main/configs/datasets/collections) houses various dataset collections, making it convenient for comprehensive evaluations. OpenCompass often uses [`base_medium.py`](/configs/datasets/collections/base_medium.py) for full-scale model testing. To replicate results, simply import that file, for example:\n\n```bash\npython run.py --models hf_llama_7b --datasets base_medium\n```\n\n```{seealso}\nYou can find more information from [Dataset Preparation](../user_guides/datasets.md).\n```\n:::\n\n\n````\n\n`````\n\n```{warning}\nOpenCompass usually assumes network is available.

In this case, the experiment result will be saved to `outputs/demo/{TIMESTAMP}`.\n- `-r`: Reuse existing inference results, and skip the finished tasks. If followed by a timestamp, the result under that timestamp in the workspace path will be reused; otherwise, the latest result in the specified workspace path will be reused.\n- `--mode all`: Specify a specific stage of the task.\n  - all: (Default) Perform a complete evaluation, including inference and evaluation.\n  - infer: Perform inference on each dataset.\n  - eval: Perform evaluation based on the inference results.\n  - viz: Display evaluation results only.\n- `--max-partition-size 2000`: Dataset partition size. Some datasets may be large, and using this parameter can split them into multiple sub-tasks to efficiently utilize resources. However, if the partition is too fine, the overall speed may be slower due to longer model loading times.\n- `--max-num-workers 32`: Maximum number of parallel tasks. In distributed environments such as Slurm, this parameter specifies the maximum number of submitted tasks. In a local environment, it specifies the maximum number of tasks executed in parallel.
