DO NOT EVER USE `CMD <test command>`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to the test command, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN <test command>`\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile.", "sent": true, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "description": "Given your current knowledge of the repo, provide a dockerfile to this function that clones the repo and sets up the repo, then runs tests", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dockerfile": {"type": "string", "description": "The contents of the dockerfile"}}, "required": ["dockerfile"]}}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_gMgOGGtPLaxTPBktqTyHD0AU", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"FROM python:3.9\\n\\n# Set the working directory\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the entire repository into the container\\nCOPY . /app/\\n\\n# Install the main dependencies\\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\\n\\n# Install the testing dependencies\\nRUN pip install -r requirements-test.txt\\n\\n# Run the test suite to verify everything works\\nRUN pytest\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_gMgOGGtPLaxTPBktqTyHD0AU", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
