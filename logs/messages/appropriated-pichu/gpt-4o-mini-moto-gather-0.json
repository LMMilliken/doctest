For writing these tests, you must not make use of `boto` to create resources. You will need to use the backend model methods to provision the resources. This is to make tests compatible with the moto server. You must make tests for the resource type to test listing and object fetching.\n\n- Test the config dict for all scenarios (ie for `IAM::Policy`, write `tests.tests_iam.test_policy_config_dict`). For writing this test, you'll need to create resources in the same way as the first test (without using `boto`), in every meaningful configuration that would produce a different config dict. Then, query the backend and ensure each of the dicts are as you expect.\n\n- Test that everything works end to end with the `boto` clients. (ie for `IAM::Policy`, write `tests.tests_iam.test_policy_config_client`). The main two items to test will be the `boto.client('config').list_discovered_resources()`, `boto.client('config').list_aggregate_discovered_resources()`, `moto.client('config').batch_get_resource_config()`, and `moto.client('config').batch_aggregate_get_resource_config()`. This test doesn't have to be super thorough, but it basically tests that the front end and backend logic all works together and returns correct resources.
