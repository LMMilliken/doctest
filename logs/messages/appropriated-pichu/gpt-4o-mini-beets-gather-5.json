You may want to follow `@b33ts`_ on Twitter to hear about progress on\nnew versions.\n\n.. _@b33ts: https://twitter.com/b33ts\n\nInstalling by Hand on macOS 10.11 and Higher\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nStarting with version 10.11 (El Capitan), macOS has a new security feature\ncalled `System Integrity Protection`_ (SIP) that prevents you from modifying\nsome parts of the system. This means that some ``pip`` commands may fail with a\npermissions error. (You probably *won't* run into this if you've installed\nPython yourself with `Homebrew`_ or otherwise. You can also try `MacPorts`_.)\n\nIf this happens, you can install beets for the current user only by typing\n``pip install --user beets``. If you do that, you might want to add\n``~/Library/Python/3.6/bin`` to your ``$PATH``.\n\n.. _System Integrity Protection: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899\n.. _Homebrew: https://brew.sh\n\nInstalling on Windows\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nInstalling beets on Windows can be tricky. Following these steps might help you\nget it right:\n\n1. If you don't have it, `install Python`_ (you want at least Python 3.8). The\n   installer should give you the option to \"add Python to PATH.\" Check this\n   box. If you do that, you can skip the next step.\n\n2. If you haven't done so already, set your ``PATH`` environment variable to\n   include Python and its scripts. To do so, open the \"Settings\" application, \n   then access the \"System\" screen, then access the \"About\" tab, and then hit \n   \"Advanced system settings\" located on the right side of the screen. This \n   should open the \"System Properties\" screen, then select the \"Advanced\" tab, \n   then hit the \"Environmental Variables...\" button, and then look for the PATH \n   variable in the table. Add the following to the end of the variable's value: \n   ``;C:\\Python37;C:\\Python37\\Scripts``. You may need to adjust these paths to \n   point to your Python installation.\n\n3. Now install beets by running: ``pip install beets``\n\n4. You're all set! Type ``beet`` at the command prompt to make sure everything's\n   in order.\n\nWindows users may also want to install a context menu item for importing files\ninto beets. Download the `beets.reg`_ file and open it in a text file to make\nsure the paths to Python match your system. Then double-click the file add the\nnecessary keys to your registry. You can then right-click a directory and\nchoose \"Import with beets\".\n\nBecause I don't use Windows myself, I may have missed something.

This means that some ``pip`` commands may fail with a\npermissions error. (You probably *won't* run into this if you've installed\nPython yourself with `Homebrew`_ or otherwise. You can also try `MacPorts`_.)\n\nIf this happens, you can install beets for the current user only by typing\n``pip install --user beets``. If you do that, you might want to add\n``~/Library/Python/3.6/bin`` to your ``$PATH``.\n\n.. _System Integrity Protection: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899\n.. _Homebrew: https://brew.sh\n\nInstalling on Windows\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nInstalling beets on Windows can be tricky. Following these steps might help you\nget it right:\n\n1. If you don't have it, `install Python`_ (you want at least Python 3.8). The\n   installer should give you the option to \"add Python to PATH.\" Check this\n   box. If you do that, you can skip the next step.\n\n2. If you haven't done so already, set your ``PATH`` environment variable to\n   include Python and its scripts. To do so, open the \"Settings\" application, \n   then access the \"System\" screen, then access the \"About\" tab, and then hit \n   \"Advanced system settings\" located on the right side of the screen. This \n   should open the \"System Properties\" screen, then select the \"Advanced\" tab, \n   then hit the \"Environmental Variables...\" button, and then look for the PATH \n   variable in the table. Add the following to the end of the variable's value: \n   ``;C:\\Python37;C:\\Python37\\Scripts``. You may need to adjust these paths to \n   point to your Python installation.\n\n3. Now install beets by running: ``pip install beets``\n\n4. You're all set! Type ``beet`` at the command prompt to make sure everything's\n   in order.\n\nWindows users may also want to install a context menu item for importing files\ninto beets. Download the `beets.reg`_ file and open it in a text file to make\nsure the paths to Python match your system. Then double-click the file add the\nnecessary keys to your registry. You can then right-click a directory and\nchoose \"Import with beets\".\n\nBecause I don't use Windows myself, I may have missed something.
