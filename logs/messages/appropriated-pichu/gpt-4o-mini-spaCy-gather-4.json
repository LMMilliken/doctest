On Ubuntu, this can be done with `sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev git`. 3. **Create a Virtual Environment**: After cloning, create a virtual environment with `python -m venv .env` and activate it with `source .env/bin/activate`. 4. **Install Required Packages**: Upgrade pip and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` with `python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel` followed by `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 5. **Install spaCy in Editable Mode**: Use `pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .` to install the project in editable mode, allowing for development. 6. **Run Tests**: Use pytest to run tests, which can be invoked with `pytest` command. 7. **Additional Notes**: For optional features, install with extras using `pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .[lookups,cuda102]`.
