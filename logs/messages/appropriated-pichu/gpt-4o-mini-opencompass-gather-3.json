In this case, the experiment result will be saved to `outputs/demo/{TIMESTAMP}`.\n- `-r`: Reuse existing inference results, and skip the finished tasks. If followed by a timestamp, the result under that timestamp in the workspace path will be reused; otherwise, the latest result in the specified workspace path will be reused.\n- `--mode all`: Specify a specific stage of the task.\n  - all: (Default) Perform a complete evaluation, including inference and evaluation.\n  - infer: Perform inference on each dataset.\n  - eval: Perform evaluation based on the inference results.\n  - viz: Display evaluation results only.\n- `--max-partition-size 2000`: Dataset partition size. Some datasets may be large, and using this parameter can split them into multiple sub-tasks to efficiently utilize resources. However, if the partition is too fine, the overall speed may be slower due to longer model loading times.\n- `--max-num-workers 32`: Maximum number of parallel tasks. In distributed environments such as Slurm, this parameter specifies the maximum number of submitted tasks. In a local environment, it specifies the maximum number of tasks executed in parallel. Note that the actual number of parallel tasks depends on the available GPU resources and may not be equal to this number.\n\nIf you are not performing the evaluation on your local machine but using a Slurm cluster, you can specify the following parameters:\n\n- `--slurm`: Submit tasks using Slurm on the cluster.\n- `--partition(-p) my_part`: Slurm cluster partition.\n- `--retry 2`: Number of retries for failed tasks.\n\n```{seealso}\nThe entry also supports submitting tasks to Alibaba Deep Learning Center (DLC), and more customized evaluation strategies.

In this case, the experiment result will be saved to `outputs/demo/{TIMESTAMP}`.\n- `-r`: Reuse existing inference results, and skip the finished tasks. If followed by a timestamp, the result under that timestamp in the workspace path will be reused; otherwise, the latest result in the specified workspace path will be reused.\n- `--mode all`: Specify a specific stage of the task.\n  - all: (Default) Perform a complete evaluation, including inference and evaluation.\n  - infer: Perform inference on each dataset.\n  - eval: Perform evaluation based on the inference results.\n  - viz: Display evaluation results only.\n- `--max-partition-size 2000`: Dataset partition size. Some datasets may be large, and using this parameter can split them into multiple sub-tasks to efficiently utilize resources. However, if the partition is too fine, the overall speed may be slower due to longer model loading times.\n- `--max-num-workers 32`: Maximum number of parallel tasks. In distributed environments such as Slurm, this parameter specifies the maximum number of submitted tasks. In a local environment, it specifies the maximum number of tasks executed in parallel. Note that the actual number of parallel tasks depends on the available GPU resources and may not be equal to this number.\n\nIf you are not performing the evaluation on your local machine but using a Slurm cluster, you can specify the following parameters:\n\n- `--slurm`: Submit tasks using Slurm on the cluster.\n- `--partition(-p) my_part`: Slurm cluster partition.\n- `--retry 2`: Number of retries for failed tasks.\n\n```{seealso}\nThe entry also supports submitting tasks to Alibaba Deep Learning Center (DLC), and more customized evaluation strategies.
