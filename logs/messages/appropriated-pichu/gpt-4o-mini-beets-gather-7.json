Type:\n      ``pip install https://github.com/beetbox/beets/tarball/master``\n   -  Use ``pip`` to install an \"editable\" version of beets based on an\n      automatic source checkout. For example, run\n      ``pip install -e git+https://github.com/beetbox/beets#egg=beets``\n      to clone beets and install it, allowing you to modify the source\n      in-place to try out changes.\n   -  Clone source code and install it in editable mode\n\n      .. code-block:: shell\n\n         git clone https://github.com/beetbox/beets.git\n         poetry install\n\n      This approach lets you decide where the\n      source is stored, with any changes immediately reflected in your\n      environment.\n\nMore details about the beets source are available on the :doc:`developer documentation </dev/index>`\npages.\n\n\n.. _bugs:\n\n\"\nuse the tools to either get more information or conclude your task once you are confident."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.\nYou can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.\nWhenever you find a documentation file, you will submit it using the submit_documentation tool, then continue your search.
