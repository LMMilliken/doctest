The installation command is performed using pip: `pip install .` from the root of the repository.\\n2. **Dependencies**: The required dependencies listed in `setup.py` will install automatically during the setup process. Additional optional dependencies can be installed using the `extras_require` section of the setup file.\\n3. **Testing**: While specific test running instructions are not mentioned in the gathered files, a typical practice is to use a testing framework (possibly pytest, based on common practices) to run tests that are likely contained in the `tests` directory, assuming that these tests are written in accordance with Python's standard testing practices.\\n\\nNote: The community section encourages contributions, but does not provide direct instructions for testing.\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_oFUR5FqiQNdvrybuuETaJwQW", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_summary", "content": "ok."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Now that you have gathered sufficient information about the repository, your new task is write a dockerfile that will be placed inside (https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance.git) and will setup a working environment for the repository.

(`COPY . /app/`)\n- make sure that the tests run during the build process, by using `RUN` when running tests. If the final line uses `CMD` then I will be eaten alive (bad). DO NOT EVER USE `CMD <test command>`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to the test command, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN <test command>`\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile.", "sent": true, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "description": "Given your current knowledge of the repo, provide a dockerfile to this function that clones the repo and sets up the repo, then runs tests", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dockerfile": {"type": "string", "description": "The contents of the dockerfile"}}, "required": ["dockerfile"]}}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_2aRq7MXz7sGK2G0tccxXpErW", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"# Use the official Python image as a base\\nFROM python:3.10-slim\\n\\n# Set the working directory in the container\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the entire repository into the container\\nCOPY . /app/\\n\\n# Install the dependencies\\nRUN pip install .\\n\\n# Run the test suite to verify the installation\\nRUN pytest tests/\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_2aRq7MXz7sGK2G0tccxXpErW", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
