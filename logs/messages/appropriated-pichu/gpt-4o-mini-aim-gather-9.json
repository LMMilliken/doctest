This is particularly important for significant changes, and will typically be labeled during triage with `phase / exploring`.\n\nAfter you have agreed upon an implementation strategy for your feature or patch with an Aim maintainer, the next step is to introduce your changes as a pull request against the Aim Repository.\n\nOnce your pull request against the Aim Repository has been merged, your corresponding changes will be automatically included in the next Aim release.

(`COPY . /app/`)\n- make sure that the tests run during the build process, by using `RUN` when running tests. If the final line uses `CMD` then I will be eaten alive (bad). DO NOT EVER USE `CMD <test command>`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to the test command, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN <test command>`\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile.", "sent": true, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "description": "Given your current knowledge of the repo, provide a dockerfile to this function that clones the repo and sets up the repo, then runs tests", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dockerfile": {"type": "string", "description": "The contents of the dockerfile"}}, "required": ["dockerfile"]}}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_JPVLjwV3TnqmORSj8t3iBpfX", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"# Start with a Python base image\\nFROM python:3.9-slim\\n\\n# Set the working directory in the container\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the entire repository into the container\\nCOPY . /app/\\n\\n# Install the development dependencies\\nRUN pip install -r requirements.dev.txt\\n\\n# Install the main project dependencies\\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\\n\\n# Run the tests to verify the installation\\nRUN pytest tests/\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_JPVLjwV3TnqmORSj8t3iBpfX", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
