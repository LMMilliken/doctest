section:\n\"\nIn line with our aim, we identify the following themes:\n\n- **Exploratory data analysis**: \n  The core of the package is a dataset summarization by its main characteristics, which is complemented with warnings on data issues and visualisations.\n\n  _Suggestions for contribution_: \n  Extend the support of more data types (think of paths, location or GPS coordinates and ordinal data types),\n  text data (e.g. encoding, vocabulary size, spelling errors, language detection), \n  time series analysis, \n  or even images (e.g. dimensions, EXIF).\n  \n  _Related_: [#7][i7], [#129][i129], [#190][i190], [#204][i204] or [create one](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling/issues/new/choose).\n\n- **Stability, Performance and Restricted environment compatibility:** \n  Data exploration takes place in all kinds of conditions, on the latest machine learning platforms with enormous dataset to managed environments in large corporations.\n  `ydata-profiling` helps analysts, researchers and engineers alike in these cases.\n  We do this by fixing bugs, improving performance on big datasets and adding environment compatibility.\n  \n  _Suggestions for contribution (Performance)_: \n  Perform concurrency analysis or profile execution times and leverage the gained insights for improved performance (e.g. multiprocessing, cython, numba) or test the performance of `ydata-profiling` with [big data sets](https://www.stats.govt.nz/large-datasets/csv-files-for-download/) and corresponding commonly used data formats (such as parquet). \n  \n  _Suggestions for contribution (Stability)_: \n  Either review the code and add tests or watch the [issues page](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling/issues) and [Stackoverflow tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ydata-profiling) to find current issues.\n     \n  _Related_: [#98][i98], [#122][i122] or [create one](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling/issues/new/choose).\n\n- **Interaction, presentation and user experience**: \n  As `ydata-profiling` eases exploratory data analysis, working with the package should reflect that.\n  Interaction and user experience plays a central role in working with the package.\n  Working on interactive and static features is possible through the modular nature of the package: the user can configure which features to use.\n\n  _Suggestions for contribution (interactivity)_:\n  Interactivity allows for more user friendly applications, including but not limited to on demand analysis (don't compute what you don't want to see) and interactive histograms and correlations. \n  This is ideal for smaller datasets, where we can compute this on-the-fly. \n  `ipywidgets` would be a great place to start (e.g. [widget based view](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20List.html)).\n\n  _Suggestions for contribution (presentation)_:\n  Other forms of distribution than HTML (for example PDF or packaged as an GUI application via [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro))\n  Users should be able to share reports (improve size of labels in graph, add explanations to correlation matrices and allow for styling/branding).\n\n  _Related_: [#161][i161], [#175][i175], [#191][i191] or [create
