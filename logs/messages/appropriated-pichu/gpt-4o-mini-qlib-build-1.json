We can define the required packages in separate text files or a single requirements file, and then reference it directly in the Dockerfile instead of trying to echo them. \n\nFor simplicity, we will create a combined requirements file as follows and revise the Dockerfile:\n\n1. Combine all package dependencies into a single `requirements.txt` file.\n2. Reference this file in the Dockerfile for installation.\n\nLet\u2019s assume, based on previous information, I will create a `requirements.txt` file containing all the required packages:\n\n```\nnumpy>=1.12.0,<1.24\npandas>=0.25.1\nscipy>=1.7.3\nrequests>=2.18.0\nsacred>=0.7.4\npython-socketio\nredis>=3.0.1\npython-redis-lock>=3.3.1\nschedule>=0.6.0\ncvxpy>=1.0.21\nhyperopt==0.1.2\nfire>=0.3.1\nstatsmodels\nxlrd>=1.0.0\nplotly>=4.12.0\nmatplotlib>=3.3\ntables>=3.6.1\npyyaml>=5.3.1\nmlflow>=1.12.1,<=1.30.0\npackaging<22\ntqdm\nloguru\nlightgbm>=3.3.0\ntornado\njoblib>=0.17.0\nruamel.yaml<=0.17.36\npymongo==3.7.2\nscikit-learn>=0.22\ndill\nfilelock\njinja2\ngym\ncryptography\ncoverage\npytest>=3\nsphinx\nsphinx_rtd_theme\npre-commit\nwheel\nsetuptools\nblack\npylint<=2.17.6\nmypy<0.981\nflake8\nnbqa\njupyter\nnbconvert\nimportlib-metadata<5.0.0\nreadthedocs_sphinx_ext\ncmake\nlxml\nbaostock\nyahooquery\nscs<=3.2.4\ntianshou<=0.4.10\ngym>=0.24\n```\n\nNow, I will adjust the Dockerfile to utilize this `requirements.txt`. The new Dockerfile will look like this:\n\n```Dockerfile\n# Use the official Python 3.8 image as the base image\nFROM python:3.8\n\n# Set the working directory in the container\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy the entire repository into the container\nCOPY . /app/\n\n# Install the necessary system packages\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    gcc \\\n    g++ \\\n    python3-dev \\\n    && apt-get clean\n\n# Install dependencies from requirements.txt\nCOPY requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Install the package from the repository\nRUN pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .\n\n# Run the test suite\nRUN pytest\n```\n\nThis approach will eliminate any parsing issues related to package installation during the Docker build process.
