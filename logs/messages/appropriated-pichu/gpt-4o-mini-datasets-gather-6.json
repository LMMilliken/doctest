Prerequisites:\n   - Dependencies:\n     - twine: `pip install twine`\n   - Create an account in (and join the 'datasets' project):\n     - PyPI: https://pypi.org/\n     - Test PyPI: https://test.pypi.org/\n   - Don't break `transformers`: run the `transformers` CI using the `main` branch and make sure it's green.\n     - In `transformers`, use `datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets`\n       Add a step to install `datasets@main` after `save_cache` in .circleci/create_circleci_config.py:\n       ```\n       steps.append({\"run\": {\"name\": \"Install `datasets@main`\", \"command\": 'pip uninstall datasets -y && pip install \"datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets\"'}})\n       ```\n     - and then run the CI\n\n1. Create the release branch from main branch:\n     ```\n     git checkout main\n     git pull upstream main\n     git checkout -b release-VERSION\n     ```\n\n2. Change the version to the release VERSION in:\n   - __init__.py\n   - setup.py\n\n3. Commit these changes, push and create a Pull Request:\n     ```\n     git add -u\n     git commit -m \"Release: VERSION\"\n     git push upstream release-VERSION\n     ```\n   - Go to: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/new/release-VERSION\n   - Create pull request\n\n4. From your local release branch, build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between\n   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).\n   - First, delete any building directories that may exist from previous builds:\n     - build\n     - dist\n   - From the top level directory, build the wheel and the sources:\n       ```\n       python setup.py bdist_wheel\n       python setup.py sdist\n       ```\n   - You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.\n\n5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the test PyPI server:\n     ```\n     twine upload dist/* -r testpypi\n     ```\n   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv/notebook by running:\n     ```\n     pip install huggingface-hub fsspec aiohttp\n     pip install -U tqdm pyarrow\n     pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi datasets\n     ```\n\n6. Upload the final version to the actual PyPI:\n     ```\n     twine upload dist/* -r pypi\n     ```\n\n7. Make the release on GitHub once everything is looking hunky-dory:\n   - Merge the release Pull Request\n   - Create a new release: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/releases/new\n   - Choose a tag: Introduce the new VERSION as tag, that will be created when you publish the release\n     - Create new tag VERSION on publish\n   - Release title: Introduce the new VERSION as well\n   - Describe the release\n     - Use \"Generate release notes\" button for automatic generation\n   - Publish release\n\n8. Set the dev version\n   - Create the dev-version branch from the main branch:\n       ```\n       git checkout main\n       git pull upstream main\n       git branch -D dev-version\n       git checkout -b dev-version\n       ```\n   - Change the version to X.X.X+1.dev0 (e.g. VERSION=1.18.3 -> 1.18.4.dev0) in:\n     - __init__.py\n     - setup.py\n   - Commit these changes, push and create a Pull Request:\n       ```\n       git add -u\n       git commit -m \"Set dev version\"\n       git push upstream dev-version\n       ```\n     - Go to: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/new/dev-version\n     - Create pull request\n   - Merge the dev version Pull Request\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom setuptools import find_packages, setup\n\n\nREQUIRED_PKGS = [\n    # For file locking\n    \"filelock\",\n    # We use numpy>=1.17 to have np.random.Generator (Dataset shuffling)\n    \"numpy>=1.17\",\n    # Backend and serialization.\n    # Minimum 15.0.0 to be able to cast dictionary types to their underlying types\n    \"pyarrow>=15.0.0\",\n    # For smart caching dataset processing\n    \"dill>=0.3.0,<0.3.9\",  # tmp pin until dill has official support for determinism see https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues/19\n    # For performance gains with apache arrow\n    \"pandas\",\n    # for downloading datasets over HTTPS\n    \"requests>=2.32.2\",\n    # progress bars in download and scripts\n    \"tqdm>=4.66.3\",\n    # for fast hashing\n    \"xxhash\",\n    # for better multiprocessing\n    \"multiprocess\",\n    # to save datasets locally or on any filesystem\n    # minimum 2023.1.0 to support protocol=kwargs in fsspec's `open`, `get_fs_token_paths`, etc.: see https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec/pull/1143\n    \"fsspec[http]>=2023.1.0,<=2024.6.1\",\n    # for data streaming via http\n    \"aiohttp\",\n    # To get datasets from the Datasets Hub on huggingface.co\n    \"huggingface-hub>=0.22.0\",\n    # Utilities from PyPA to e.g., compare versions\n    \"packaging\",\n    # To parse YAML metadata from dataset cards\n    \"pyyaml>=5.1\",\n]\n\nAUDIO_REQUIRE = [\n    \"soundfile>=0.12.1\",\n    \"librosa\",\n    \"soxr>=0.4.0;

Prerequisites:\n   - Dependencies:\n     - twine: `pip install twine`\n   - Create an account in (and join the 'datasets' project):\n     - PyPI: https://pypi.org/\n     - Test PyPI: https://test.pypi.org/\n   - Don't break `transformers`: run the `transformers` CI using the `main` branch and make sure it's green.\n     - In `transformers`, use `datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets`\n       Add a step to install `datasets@main` after `save_cache` in .circleci/create_circleci_config.py:\n       ```\n       steps.append({\"run\": {\"name\": \"Install `datasets@main`\", \"command\": 'pip uninstall datasets -y && pip install \"datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets\"'}})\n       ```\n     - and then run the CI\n\n1. Create the release branch from main branch:\n     ```\n     git checkout main\n     git pull upstream main\n     git checkout -b release-VERSION\n     ```\n\n2. Change the version to the release VERSION in:\n   - __init__.py\n   - setup.py\n\n3. Commit these changes, push and create a Pull Request:\n     ```\n     git add -u\n     git commit -m \"Release: VERSION\"\n     git push upstream release-VERSION\n     ```\n   - Go to: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/new/release-VERSION\n   - Create pull request\n\n4. From your local release branch, build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between\n   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).\n   - First, delete any building directories that may exist from previous builds:\n     - build\n     - dist\n   - From the top level directory, build the wheel and the sources:\n       ```\n       python setup.py bdist_wheel\n       python setup.py sdist\n       ```\n   - You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.\n\n5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the test PyPI server:\n     ```\n     twine upload dist/* -r testpypi\n     ```\n   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv/notebook by running:\n     ```\n     pip install huggingface-hub fsspec aiohttp\n     pip install -U tqdm pyarrow\n     pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi datasets\n     ```\n\n6. Upload the final version to the actual PyPI:\n     ```\n     twine upload dist/* -r pypi\n     ```\n\n7. Make the release on GitHub once everything is looking hunky-dory:\n   - Merge the release Pull Request\n   - Create a new release: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/releases/new\n   - Choose a tag: Introduce the new VERSION as tag, that will be created when you publish the release\n     - Create new tag VERSION on publish\n   - Release title: Introduce the new VERSION as well\n   - Describe the release\n     - Use \"Generate release notes\" button for automatic generation\n   - Publish release\n\n8. Set the dev version\n   - Create the dev-version branch from the main branch:\n       ```\n       git checkout main\n       git pull upstream main\n       git branch -D dev-version\n       git checkout -b dev-version\n       ```\n   - Change the version to X.X.X+1.dev0 (e.g. VERSION=1.18.3 -> 1.18.4.dev0) in:\n     - __init__.py\n     - setup.py\n   - Commit these changes, push and create a Pull Request:\n       ```\n       git add -u\n       git commit -m \"Set dev version\"\n       git push upstream dev-version\n       ```\n     - Go to: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/new/dev-version\n     - Create pull request\n   - Merge the dev version Pull Request\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom setuptools import find_packages, setup\n\n\nREQUIRED_PKGS = [\n    # For file locking\n    \"filelock\",\n    # We use numpy>=1.17 to have np.random.Generator (Dataset shuffling)\n    \"numpy>=1.17\",\n    # Backend and serialization.\n    # Minimum 15.0.0 to be able to cast dictionary types to their underlying types\n    \"pyarrow>=15.0.0\",\n    # For smart caching dataset processing\n    \"dill>=0.3.0,<0.3.9\",  # tmp pin until dill has official support for determinism see https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues/19\n    # For performance gains with apache arrow\n    \"pandas\",\n    # for downloading datasets over HTTPS\n    \"requests>=2.32.2\",\n    # progress bars in download and scripts\n    \"tqdm>=4.66.3\",\n    # for fast hashing\n    \"xxhash\",\n    # for better multiprocessing\n    \"multiprocess\",\n    # to save datasets locally or on any filesystem\n    # minimum 2023.1.0 to support protocol=kwargs in fsspec's `open`, `get_fs_token_paths`, etc.: see https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec/pull/1143\n    \"fsspec[http]>=2023.1.0,<=2024.6.1\",\n    # for data streaming via http\n    \"aiohttp\",\n    # To get datasets from the Datasets Hub on huggingface.co\n    \"huggingface-hub>=0.22.0\",\n    # Utilities from PyPA to e.g., compare versions\n    \"packaging\",\n    # To parse YAML metadata from dataset cards\n    \"pyyaml>=5.1\",\n]\n\nAUDIO_REQUIRE = [\n    \"soundfile>=0.12.1\",\n    \"librosa\",\n    \"soxr>=0.4.0;

(`COPY . /app/`)\n- make sure that the tests run during the build process, by using `RUN` when running tests. If the final line uses `CMD` then I will be eaten alive (bad). DO NOT EVER USE `CMD <test command>`.\n    - Dont add any additional arguments to the test command, that makes it harder for me to identify whether the build was successful.\n    - Make sure your final line is `RUN <test command>`\n\nuse the `submit_dockerfile` function to provide the dockerfile.", "sent": true, "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "description": "Given your current knowledge of the repo, provide a dockerfile to this function that clones the repo and sets up the repo, then runs tests", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dockerfile": {"type": "string", "description": "The contents of the dockerfile"}}, "required": ["dockerfile"]}}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_jERwL5oCTnEPG9zsa6g89V67", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "submit_dockerfile", "arguments": "{\"dockerfile\":\"FROM python:3.9-slim\\n\\n# Set the working directory\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy the entire repository into the container\\nCOPY . /app/\\n\\n# Install dependencies using the setup.py file\\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir .\\n\\n# Run the tests to verify the installation\\nRUN pytest\"}"}}]}, {"tool_call_id": "call_jERwL5oCTnEPG9zsa6g89V67", "role": "tool", "name": "submit_dockerfile", "content": "ok."}]
