For example, do this:\n\n   .. code-block:: python\n\n       with g.lib.transaction() as tx:\n             rows = tx.query('SELECT DISTINCT \"{0}\" FROM \"{1}\" ORDER BY \"{2}\"'\n                             .format(field, model._table, sort_field))\n\n   To fetch Item objects from the database, use lib.items(\u2026) and supply\n   a query as an argument. Resist the urge to write raw SQL for your\n   query. If you must use lower-level queries into the database, do\n   this:\n\n   .. code-block:: python\n\n       with lib.transaction() as tx:\n           rows = tx.query('SELECT \u2026')\n\n   Transaction objects help control concurrent access to the database\n   and assist in debugging conflicting accesses.\n-  Always use the `future\n   imports <http://docs.python.org/library/__future__.html>`__\n   ``print_function``, ``division``, and ``absolute_import``, but *not*\n   ``unicode_literals``. These help keep your code modern and will help\n   in the eventual move to Python 3.\n-  ``str.format()`` should be used instead of the ``%`` operator\n-  Never ``print`` informational messages; use the\n   `logging <http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html>`__ module\n   instead.
