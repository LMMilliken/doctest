Create a new branch to hold your development changes:\n\n    ```bash\n    git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n    ```\n\n    **do not** work on the `main` branch.\n\n4. Set up a development environment by running the following command in a virtual environment:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -e \".[dev]\"\n    ```\n\n   (If datasets was already installed in the virtual environment, remove\n   it with `pip uninstall datasets` before reinstalling it in editable\n   mode with the `-e` flag.)\n\n5. Develop the features on your branch.\n\n6. Format your code. Run `black` and `ruff` so that your newly added files look nice with the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    make style\n    ```\n   \n7. _(Optional)_ You can also use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to format your code automatically each time run `git commit`, instead of running `make style` manually. \nTo do this, install `pre-commit` via `pip install pre-commit` and then run `pre-commit install` in the project's root directory to set up the hooks.\nNote that if any files were formatted by `pre-commit` hooks during committing, you have to run `git commit` again .\n\n\n8. Once you're happy with your contribution, add your changed files and make a commit to record your changes locally:\n\n    ```bash\n    git add -u\n    git commit\n    ```\n\n    It is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original\n    repository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:\n\n    ```bash\n    git fetch upstream\n    git rebase upstream/main\n    ```\n\n9. Once you are satisfied, push the changes to your fork repo using:\n\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n   ```\n\n   Go the webpage of your fork on GitHub.

Create a new branch to hold your development changes:\n\n    ```bash\n    git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n    ```\n\n    **do not** work on the `main` branch.\n\n4. Set up a development environment by running the following command in a virtual environment:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -e \".[dev]\"\n    ```\n\n   (If datasets was already installed in the virtual environment, remove\n   it with `pip uninstall datasets` before reinstalling it in editable\n   mode with the `-e` flag.)\n\n5. Develop the features on your branch.\n\n6. Format your code. Run `black` and `ruff` so that your newly added files look nice with the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    make style\n    ```\n   \n7. _(Optional)_ You can also use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to format your code automatically each time run `git commit`, instead of running `make style` manually. \nTo do this, install `pre-commit` via `pip install pre-commit` and then run `pre-commit install` in the project's root directory to set up the hooks.\nNote that if any files were formatted by `pre-commit` hooks during committing, you have to run `git commit` again .\n\n\n8. Once you're happy with your contribution, add your changed files and make a commit to record your changes locally:\n\n    ```bash\n    git add -u\n    git commit\n    ```\n\n    It is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original\n    repository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:\n\n    ```bash\n    git fetch upstream\n    git rebase upstream/main\n    ```\n\n9. Once you are satisfied, push the changes to your fork repo using:\n\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n   ```\n\n   Go the webpage of your fork on GitHub.
