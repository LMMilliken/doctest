------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) api
- (dir) db
- (dir) docs
- (dir) fetcher
- (dir) handler
- (dir) helper
- (dir) test
- (dir) util
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .travis.yml
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) _config.yml
- (file) docker-compose.yml
- (file) proxyPool.py
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) setting.py
- (file) start.sh
- (file) test.py
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

There is a `requirements.txt` file present in the root directory. Since it's a common method for specifying project dependencies in Python, I believe the repository should be classified as "Installation via a requirements.txt file." Next, I would like to inspect the contents of the `README.md` file to confirm this assumption. I will use the `check_presence` and `read_file` commands to gather additional information.

The presence of a `README.md` file allows us to access additional information about the repository. My next step is to read the contents of the `README.md` file to check for any installation instructions or dependencies. I will use the `read_file` command to retrieve this information.

Based on the content of the `README.md` file, it appears that the repository contains clear installation and setup instructions, including sections for downloading the code, installing dependencies, and using Docker. Given this information, I am confident that the repository should be classified as "Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment." I will proceed with the `classify_repo` command.
