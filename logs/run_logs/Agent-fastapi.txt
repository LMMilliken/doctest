------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) docs
- (dir) docs_src
- (dir) fastapi
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) CITATION.cff
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) SECURITY.md
- (file) pdm_build.py
- (file) requirements-docs-tests.txt
- (file) requirements-docs.txt
- (file) requirements-tests.txt
- (file) requirements.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a `requirements.txt` file suggests that the project may be using traditional pip installation for its dependencies. It's also worth checking for a `Dockerfile` to confirm if a separate file exists for installation within a Docker container.

I will verify the presence of a `Dockerfile` and the contents of the `requirements.txt` file to determine the appropriate installation method.

The absence of a `Dockerfile` indicates that the project does not have a specific file for installation within a Docker container. I will now inspect the contents of the `requirements.txt` file to determine the appropriate installation method.

The `requirements.txt` file contains specific package requirements and seems to be the primary method for managing dependencies. This indicates that the project likely uses the traditional pip installation method. I will proceed with classifying the repository as "Installation via a requirements.txt file."
