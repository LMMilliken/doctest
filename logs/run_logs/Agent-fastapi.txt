------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) docs
- (dir) docs_src
- (dir) fastapi
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) CITATION.cff
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) SECURITY.md
- (file) pdm_build.py
- (file) requirements-docs-tests.txt
- (file) requirements-docs.txt
- (file) requirements-tests.txt
- (file) requirements.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.
