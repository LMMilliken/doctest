------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) docs
- (dir) docs_src
- (dir) fastapi
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) CITATION.cff
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) SECURITY.md
- (file) pdm_build.py
- (file) requirements-docs-tests.txt
- (file) requirements-docs.txt
- (file) requirements-tests.txt
- (file) requirements.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a requirements.txt file suggests that installation via a requirements.txt file might be a suitable method for this project. However, I would like to confirm the presence of a Dockerfile and a poetry.lock file using the provided tools before making a final determination.

I will start by checking the presence of a Dockerfile and a poetry.lock file using the `check_presence` function.

The absence of a poetry.lock file indicates that the project likely does not use Poetry for dependency management. Next, I will check if the project has any dependencies or if it has no dependencies at all, to determine the appropriate installation method.

The presence of a requirements.txt file indicates that the project uses dependencies that are likely specified in this file. Therefore, the appropriate installation method for this project is "Installation via a requirements.txt file." I will now classify the repository based on this information using the `classify_repo` command.
