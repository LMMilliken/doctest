------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) docs
- (dir) docs_src
- (dir) fastapi
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) CITATION.cff
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) SECURITY.md
- (file) pdm_build.py
- (file) requirements-docs-tests.txt
- (file) requirements-docs.txt
- (file) requirements-tests.txt
- (file) requirements.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The repository contains multiple requirements files, which indicates that it likely uses `requirements.txt` for dependency management. However, to confirm, I need to inspect the `README.md` for any specific installation instructions.

I will start by examining the `README.md` file to check for installation instructions.

### Steps to take next:
1. Read the contents of `README.md`.

Let's retrieve and inspect the contents of `README.md`.

```python
read_file('README.md')
```

The `README.md` file contains an "Installation" section, which likely provides specific instructions on how to install the project's dependencies and set up the environment. This section will be useful in determining the correct installation method.

I will inspect the content of the "Installation" section within the `README.md` file to gather the necessary information.

### Next Steps:
1. Read the content of the "Installation" section from `README.md`.

Let's inspect the "Installation" section.

```python
inspect_header('README.md', 'Installation')
```

The "Installation" section suggests using `pip install fastapi` to install dependencies, indicating the use of `requirements.txt` for installation. This aligns with the presence of multiple `requirements` files in the directory.

Based on this information, I will classify the repository as one that uses installation via a `requirements.txt` file.

```python
classify_repo(1)
```
