------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) docs
- (dir) docs_src
- (dir) fastapi
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) CITATION.cff
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) SECURITY.md
- (file) pdm_build.py
- (file) requirements-docs-tests.txt
- (file) requirements-docs.txt
- (file) requirements-tests.txt
- (file) requirements.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a `requirements.txt` file suggests that the project likely uses traditional dependency management. However, it's important to confirm if there are any additional files like `poetry.lock` or a Dockerfile for installation, and in addition to this, I should check the README for any specific installation instructions.

I will start by checking the presence of specific files like `poetry.lock` or a Dockerfile, and then review the README for any installation instructions.

Based on the absence of a `poetry.lock` file and Dockerfile, and the presence of a `requirements.txt` file, it is likely that the project uses the traditional method of dependency management via the `requirements.txt` file. Next, I will proceed to review the README for any specific installation instructions.

I will now check the README for any installation instructions.

The README contains a section titled "Requirements" and "Installation", indicating that there may be specific installation instructions provided. I will extract the contents of these sections to confirm the installation method and then proceed with the classification.

The "Requirements" section in the README provides information about the dependencies used by the project, but does not explicitly detail the installation process. Based on this information and the presence of a `requirements.txt` file, it seems likely that the project should be classified as "Installation via a requirements.txt file."

I will now proceed with the classification.
