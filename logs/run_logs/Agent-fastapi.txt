------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) docs
- (dir) docs_src
- (dir) fastapi
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) CITATION.cff
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) SECURITY.md
- (file) pdm_build.py
- (file) requirements-docs-tests.txt
- (file) requirements-docs.txt
- (file) requirements-tests.txt
- (file) requirements.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The provided repo appears to be well-documented with various directories and multiple requirements files, suggesting that it likely has dependencies. The presence of `requirements.txt` files suggests that the project might utilize traditional installation methods.

Next, I will inspect the README for any installation instructions to confirm the installation method required.

I'll start by checking the presence of the README file. 

```python
check_presence("README.md")
```

The README.md file is present in the repo, which likely contains installation instructions. 

Next, I will read the contents of the README.md file to look for any installation instructions or guidance on how to handle dependencies.

```python
read_file("README.md")
```

The README.md file contains sections on "Requirements," "Installation," and "Dependencies," which likely detail the installation process and any dependencies.

Next, I will inspect the "Installation" section of the README.md file to gather precise information on the installation method.

```python
inspect_header("README.md", "Installation")
```

The "Installation" section of the README.md suggests using `pip install fastapi`, implying the project uses a requirements file for installation.

Based on this information, I am confident that the appropriate method of installation for this repo is via a `requirements.txt` file.

```python
classify_repo(1)
```
