------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) docs
- (dir) installers
- (dir) interpreter
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) poetry.lock
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a `poetry.lock` file suggests that the project is using Poetry as its dependency manager. Since it's a Python project, it's likely that the installation can be done via a `requirements.txt` file or a `poetry.lock` file. To confirm, I will check the contents of the README and look for any specific installation instructions. I will also check for the presence of a `Dockerfile` or any other installation-related files.

 You can use the `inspect_header` function to see the content any file heading.
use the tools to either get more information or make a guess once you are confident.

The README does not contain specific installation instructions. The next step is to check for the presence of a `Dockerfile` or a `poetry.lock` file to determine the appropriate installation method. I will also confirm the presence of a `requirements.txt` file.

The absence of a Dockerfile, along with the presence of a `poetry.lock` file, suggests that the appropriate installation method for this project is via a `poetry.lock` file. I will proceed with classifying the repository as "Contains a poetry.lock file".
