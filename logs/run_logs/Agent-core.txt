------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) .vscode
- (dir) homeassistant
- (dir) machine
- (dir) pylint
- (dir) rootfs
- (dir) script
- (dir) tests
- (file) .core_files.yaml
- (file) .coveragerc
- (file) .dockerignore
- (file) .git-blame-ignore-revs
- (file) .gitattributes
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .hadolint.yaml
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) .prettierignore
- (file) .strict-typing
- (file) .yamllint
- (file) CLA.md
- (file) CODEOWNERS
- (file) CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) Dockerfile.dev
- (file) LICENSE.md
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) README.rst
- (file) build.yaml
- (file) codecov.yml
- (file) mypy.ini
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) requirements_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test.txt
- (file) requirements_test_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test_pre_commit.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The provided repository seems to have various directories, configuration files, and multiple requirements files, indicating that it likely has dependencies. The presence of `requirements.txt` and other similarly named files suggests dependencies might be managed using `requirements.txt`.

Next, I would like to inspect the `README.rst` file to look for any installation instructions.

Let's start by retrieving the contents of `README.rst` to gather more information.

here are the section headers of the file:

The `README.rst` file only mentions the section header "Home Assistant" and `Chat Status`, which does not provide direct insight into installation instructions.

Next, let's inspect the content under the "Home Assistant" header in the `README.rst` to see if it contains any installation instructions.

The `Home Assistant` header in `README.rst` redirects to external links for installation instructions, without providing specific details directly in the file. Given the presence of multiple `requirements.txt` files in the root directory, it suggests that dependencies are managed through those files.

Given this information, I will classify the repository as one that uses installation via a `requirements.txt` file.

Let's proceed with the classification.
