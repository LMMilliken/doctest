------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) .vscode
- (dir) homeassistant
- (dir) machine
- (dir) pylint
- (dir) rootfs
- (dir) script
- (dir) tests
- (file) .core_files.yaml
- (file) .coveragerc
- (file) .dockerignore
- (file) .git-blame-ignore-revs
- (file) .gitattributes
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .hadolint.yaml
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) .prettierignore
- (file) .strict-typing
- (file) .yamllint
- (file) CLA.md
- (file) CODEOWNERS
- (file) CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) Dockerfile.dev
- (file) LICENSE.md
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) README.rst
- (file) build.yaml
- (file) codecov.yml
- (file) mypy.ini
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) requirements_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test.txt
- (file) requirements_test_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test_pre_commit.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The repository contains multiple `requirements.txt` files, as well as Dockerfiles that could be used for installation or development. This suggests that dependencies are likely to be listed in one or more requirements files. To proceed, I will inspect the README file for any specific installation instructions or guidelines.

I will now retrieve the contents of the README file.

The README file's section headers suggest it is relatively detailed but didn't immediately reveal direct installation instructions. Since there are various `requirements.txt` files present, the typical method would be to confirm if these files are used for dependencies.

Next, I will inspect the contents of `requirements.txt` to confirm its use. If dependencies are listed, this will lead to the likely conclusion that Installation via a `requirements.txt` file is the appropriate choice.

The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of dependencies, indicating that dependencies are indeed managed through this file. Given this evidence, the appropriate installation method would be via the `requirements.txt`.

I will now classify the repo accordingly.
