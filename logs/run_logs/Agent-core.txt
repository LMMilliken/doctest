------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) .vscode
- (dir) homeassistant
- (dir) machine
- (dir) pylint
- (dir) rootfs
- (dir) script
- (dir) tests
- (file) .core_files.yaml
- (file) .coveragerc
- (file) .dockerignore
- (file) .git-blame-ignore-revs
- (file) .gitattributes
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .hadolint.yaml
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) .prettierignore
- (file) .strict-typing
- (file) .yamllint
- (file) CLA.md
- (file) CODEOWNERS
- (file) CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) Dockerfile.dev
- (file) LICENSE.md
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) README.rst
- (file) build.yaml
- (file) codecov.yml
- (file) mypy.ini
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) requirements_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test.txt
- (file) requirements_test_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test_pre_commit.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

The provided repository contains multiple requirement files, suggesting various sets of dependencies, and includes Dockerfiles which may indicate specific configurations for installation and development setups. The next step is to inspect the README file to check for any specific installation instructions.

I'll proceed to read the README file.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The README file contains a section header related to Home Assistant, but no direct installation instructions have been revealed yet. Given the presence of multiple `requirements.txt` files and Dockerfiles, it’s important to understand which method is recommended for installation.

I’ll inspect the content of the "Home Assistant" section in the README to gather more details.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The README file provides links to external installation instructions on the Home Assistant website, without specifying details directly in the file itself. Given the presence of multiple `requirements.txt` files, the most widely applicable guess for the installation method would likely be using a `requirements.txt` file.

I will proceed to classify this repo based on the information gathered.
