------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) .vscode
- (dir) homeassistant
- (dir) machine
- (dir) pylint
- (dir) rootfs
- (dir) script
- (dir) tests
- (file) .core_files.yaml
- (file) .coveragerc
- (file) .dockerignore
- (file) .git-blame-ignore-revs
- (file) .gitattributes
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .hadolint.yaml
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) .prettierignore
- (file) .strict-typing
- (file) .yamllint
- (file) CLA.md
- (file) CODEOWNERS
- (file) CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) Dockerfile.dev
- (file) LICENSE.md
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) README.rst
- (file) build.yaml
- (file) codecov.yml
- (file) mypy.ini
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) requirements_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test.txt
- (file) requirements_test_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test_pre_commit.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a requirements.txt file suggests that the project might be using the traditional pip installation method. However, the presence of a Dockerfile and the lack of explicit installation instructions in the README could also indicate that the project might be using Docker for installation.
I will check the presence of a poetry.lock file to confirm the usage of Poetry, and then determine the appropriate installation method based on the results.

poetry.lock does NOT exist.
use the tools to either get more information or make a guess once you are confident.

Based on the absence of a poetry.lock file and no explicit installation instructions in the README, it is likely that the project may use the traditional pip installation method via a requirements.txt file. I will proceed with the classification based on this inference.
