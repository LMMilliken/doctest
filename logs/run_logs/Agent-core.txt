------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) .vscode
- (dir) homeassistant
- (dir) machine
- (dir) pylint
- (dir) rootfs
- (dir) script
- (dir) tests
- (file) .core_files.yaml
- (file) .coveragerc
- (file) .dockerignore
- (file) .git-blame-ignore-revs
- (file) .gitattributes
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .hadolint.yaml
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) .prettierignore
- (file) .strict-typing
- (file) .yamllint
- (file) CLA.md
- (file) CODEOWNERS
- (file) CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) Dockerfile.dev
- (file) LICENSE.md
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) README.rst
- (file) build.yaml
- (file) codecov.yml
- (file) mypy.ini
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) requirements_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test.txt
- (file) requirements_test_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test_pre_commit.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The presence of the `requirements.txt` and `Dockerfile` indicates that the project may rely on the `requirements.txt` file for installation, and it provides a Dockerfile for installation. I will check the README for installation instructions to confirm this, and then classify the repository.

I will start by looking at the README file for any installation instructions.

The README file is present, so I will examine it to find any installation instructions or clues about the installation method. Once I have gathered that information, I will be able to classify the repository accurately.

I will start by extracting information from the README file to determine the installation method.

here are the section headers of the file:

The README file appears to contain multiple sections, and it's possible that installation instructions are located in one of these sections. I will use the `inspect_header` function to review the content under the relevant heading and determine the installation method before classifying the repository.
