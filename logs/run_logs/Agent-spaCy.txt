------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) bin
- (dir) examples
- (dir) extra
- (dir) licenses
- (dir) spacy
- (dir) website
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) CITATION.cff
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) Makefile
- (file) README.md
- (file) build-constraints.txt
- (file) netlify.toml
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) setup.cfg
- (file) setup.py
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a `requirements.txt` file indicates that the project may be installable via a requirements file, but I should verify its content to confirm. I will also check if there is a `poetry.lock` file to see if the project uses Poetry for dependency management.

I will start by checking the contents of the `requirements.txt` file and then verify the presence of a `poetry.lock` file.

requirements.txt does exist.
use the tools to either get more information or make a guess once you are confident.

The presence of a `requirements.txt` file indicates that the project may be installable via a requirements file. I will now check for the presence of a `poetry.lock` file to confirm if the project uses Poetry for dependency management.

Based on the presence of a `requirements.txt` file and the absence of a `poetry.lock` file, the project is likely to be installable via a requirements file. I will proceed with the classification.
