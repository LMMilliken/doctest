------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) bin
- (dir) examples
- (dir) extra
- (dir) licenses
- (dir) spacy
- (dir) website
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) CITATION.cff
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) Makefile
- (file) README.md
- (file) build-constraints.txt
- (file) netlify.toml
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) setup.cfg
- (file) setup.py
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The provided information hints at the presence of a `requirements.txt` file which suggests that this project likely uses this file for dependency management.

Next, I will examine the README file to look for any installation instructions that confirm the usage of the `requirements.txt` file or suggest another method.

The README file contains a section on installation (`⏳ Install spaCy`), which likely provides details on how to set up the project, possibly using the `requirements.txt` file.

Next, I will inspect the `⏳ Install spaCy` section to get specific instructions for installation to confirm the appropriate method.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The installation section in the README references the use of `pip` and `conda` for installation and directs users to the documentation for detailed instructions.

Given the presence of a `requirements.txt` file and the mention of `pip`, I am certain that the appropriate installation method is via the `requirements.txt` file. I will now classify the repo.
