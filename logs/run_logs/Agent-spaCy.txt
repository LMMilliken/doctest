------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) bin
- (dir) examples
- (dir) extra
- (dir) licenses
- (dir) spacy
- (dir) website
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) CITATION.cff
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) Makefile
- (file) README.md
- (file) build-constraints.txt
- (file) netlify.toml
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) setup.cfg
- (file) setup.py
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The provided information indicates that there is a `requirements.txt` file present, which usually implies that dependencies for the project are listed there for installation. However, I will follow your instructions to inspect the README for any specific installation instructions.

Next, I will retrieve the contents of the README file to check for any installation instructions.

Let's proceed to inspect the README file.

```python
get_file_contents('README.md')
```

The README file contains a section titled "⏳ Install spaCy," which likely includes instructions on how to install the project. This suggests there are installation steps provided.

Next, I will inspect the contents of the "⏳ Install spaCy" section to understand the recommended installation method.

```python
inspect_header('README.md', '⏳ Install spaCy')
```

The "⏳ Install spaCy" section in the README refers to using pip or conda for installation, which supports the presence of a `requirements.txt` file for dependency management.

Based on this information and the presence of the `requirements.txt` file in the repo, I am confident the appropriate classification is installation via a requirements.txt file.

```python
classify_repo(1)
```
