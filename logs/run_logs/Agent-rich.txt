------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .faq
- (dir) .github
- (dir) assets
- (dir) benchmarks
- (dir) docs
- (dir) examples

Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

The README file contains an "Installing" section which likely contains details about the preferred method for installing dependencies. This section should provide the necessary information to determine the installation method.

Next, I will inspect the content under the "Installing" header in the README.md file to find specific installation instructions.

The "Installing" section of the README indicates that `pip` is used for installation. Despite the presence of a `poetry.lock` file, the instructions suggest using `pip`.
