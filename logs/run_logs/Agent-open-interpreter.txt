------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) benchmarks
- (dir) docs
- (dir) examples
- (dir) installers
- (dir) interpreter
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) poetry.lock
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

Based on the provided information, the repo includes both a `poetry.lock` file and a `Dockerfile`. I need to inspect the README for any installation instructions.

Next, I would like to read the contents of the README.md file.

Let's proceed with reading the README.md.

```get_file README.md```

 You can use the `inspect_header` function to see the content any file heading.
use the tools to either get more information or make a guess once you are confident.

The README.md includes a section titled "Running Open Interpreter locally", which likely contains installation instructions.

Next, I will inspect the "Running Open Interpreter locally" section to gather detailed information about the installation method.

```inspect_header "Running Open Interpreter locally"```

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The "Running Open Interpreter locally" section does not provide any content, making it unhelpful for determining the installation method.

Since there is a `poetry.lock` file present, it is likely that Poetry is used for dependency management.

I will classify the repo based on the presence of the `poetry.lock` file.

```classify_repo 3```
