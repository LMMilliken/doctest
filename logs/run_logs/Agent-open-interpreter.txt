------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) docs
- (dir) examples
- (dir) installers
- (dir) interpreter
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) poetry.lock
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Based on the provided information, the presence of a `poetry.lock` file suggests that Poetry might be used for dependency management, indicating option [3] as a potential category.

Next, I would like to inspect the `README.md` for any explicit installation instructions to confirm the correct category. I'll use the `read_file` command to read the `README.md` file.

 You can use the `inspect_header` function to see the content any file heading.
use the tools to either get more information or make a guess once you are confident.

The `README.md` file contains various sections that could be relevant, including "Quick Start" and "Running Open Interpreter locally," which might provide installation instructions.

Next, I would like to inspect the "Quick Start" and "Running Open Interpreter locally" sections of the `README.md` to check for any relevant installation instructions. I'll start by inspecting the headers for these sections using the `inspect_header` function.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The "Quick Start" section shows a pip installation command, suggesting that dependencies might be managed through `requirements.txt`. However, the presence of a `poetry.lock` file indicates that Poetry is used.

To clarify the installation method, I will now inspect the "Running Open Interpreter locally" section to check if it mentions Poetry specifically.

The "Running Open Interpreter locally" section appears to be empty, providing no further clarification.

Given the presence of a `poetry.lock` file and no other conflicting information, it is most appropriate to assume that Poetry is being used for dependency management. Therefore, I will classify this repo as containing a poetry.lock file.

I will use the `classify_repo` command with option [3].
