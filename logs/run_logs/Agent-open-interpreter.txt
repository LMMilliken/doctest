------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) benchmarks
- (dir) docs
- (dir) examples
- (dir) installers
- (dir) interpreter
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) poetry.lock
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a `poetry.lock` file suggests that the project may be using Poetry for dependency management. Additionally, the Dockerfile could indicate a separate installation step for the project within a Docker container. To confirm, I will check the README for any installation instructions and inspect the contents of the repository to determine the appropriate installation method.

I will start by checking the presence of a README file to see if there are any installation instructions.

The presence of a README file indicates that there might be installation instructions provided. I will inspect the README file to look for any specific installation method suggested. Additionally, I will check for the presence of a `requirements.txt` file or a `Dockerfile` to ascertain the appropriate installation method.
I'll start by examining the README file for any installation instructions.

The README file lacks explicit installation instructions or a section dedicated to setting up the project. As a next step, I will search for a `requirements.txt` file and inspect the contents of the `installers` directory to determine the appropriate installation method.

I will start by checking for the presence of a `requirements.txt` file in the repository.

Based on the absence of a `requirements.txt` file and the lack of explicit installation instructions in the README, it seems likely that the project utilizes a different method for managing dependencies and installation. To make a more accurate classification, I will check for the presence of a `poetry.lock` file to confirm whether Poetry is used for dependency management, and then I will explore the contents of the `installers` directory to determine the installation approach.

I will start by checking for the presence of a `poetry.lock` file.

The presence of a `poetry.lock` file confirms that Poetry is used for managing dependencies. Given this, the appropriate installation method for this project would be via a `poetry.lock` file, using Poetry for dependency management. The absence of explicit installation instructions in the README suggests that a standard setup with Poetry should be sufficient for installation.

I will proceed with classifying the repository as "Contains a poetry.lock file" and then suggest the installation method using Poetry for dependency management.
