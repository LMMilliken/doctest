------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) docs
- (dir) examples
- (dir) installers
- (dir) interpreter
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) poetry.lock
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a `poetry.lock` file suggests that the project likely uses Poetry for dependency management. Additionally, the existence of a `Dockerfile` indicates that there may be a Docker-based installation process. I will confirm the presence of relevant files and then classify the repository. I'll start by checking the presence of key files using the `check_presence` command.

The presence of a README.md file indicates that there is likely documentation about installation and usage. I will review the README to find details about the installation process and then proceed with classifying the repository. I will start by examining the README.md file to gather more information.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The README contains detailed information about the project, including usage instructions, demos, and contributing guidelines, but it does not explicitly mention installation steps. Given the presence of a `poetry.lock` file, this project likely uses Poetry for dependency management. Consequently, I will proceed with classifying the repository. I will utilize the `classify_repo` command to determine the appropriate installation method.
