------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) docs
- (dir) examples
- (dir) installers
- (dir) interpreter
- (dir) tests
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) poetry.lock
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a `poetry.lock` file suggests that the project uses Poetry for dependency management. I would like to check the contents of the `README.md` file to see if there are any specific installation instructions mentioned there.
I will use the `check_presence` function to confirm the presence of any required files.

The README file appears to be focused on providing usage instructions and documentation rather than specific installation instructions. I would like to check the presence of a `requirements.txt` file and a `Dockerfile`, as well as the content of the `poetry.lock` file to determine the installation method.
I will use the `check_presence` function to confirm the presence of these files.

The absence of a `requirements.txt` file suggests that the project does not use a traditional pip-based dependency management approach. Since there is a `poetry.lock` file present, it is likely that the project uses Poetry for dependency management, and a Dockerfile may be used for installation. I will check for the presence of a Dockerfile to confirm this hypothesis.
I will use the `check_presence` function to confirm the presence of a Dockerfile.

The presence of a Dockerfile indicates that the project likely uses this file for installation within a Docker container. Additionally, the presence of a `poetry.lock` file suggests that Poetry is used for managing dependencies. Therefore, it is most appropriate to classify the repository as containing a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment.
I will use the `classify_repo` command to finalize the classification.
