------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (dir) thefuck
- (file) .editorconfig
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE.md
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) README.md
- (file) example.gif
- (file) example_instant_mode.gif
- (file) fastentrypoints.py
- (file) install.sh
- (file) release.py
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) setup.cfg
- (file) setup.py
- (file) snapcraft.yaml
- (file) tox.ini
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

Based on the provided information, this repository appears to have a `requirements.txt` file and potentially other installation scripts, suggesting it might rely on `requirements.txt` for dependencies. To confirm this, I'll inspect the README file for any installation instructions.

Next, I will retrieve the contents of the README file to look for any setup or installation guidelines.

Let's begin by reading the README file.
```
read_file("README.md")
```

The README file includes a section specifically labeled "Installation," which likely contains the necessary setup instructions. This strongly indicates that the repository might use a `requirements.txt` file or another method documented there.

Next, I will inspect the content under the "Installation" heading to understand the installation method recommended for this project.
```
inspect_header("README.md", "Installation")
```

The "Installation" section of the README suggests multiple installation methods, including using package managers and `pip`. The presence of a `requirements.txt` file and references to `pip` strongly indicates that installation via a `requirements.txt` file is appropriate, especially for setting up within a Docker container.

To proceed, I will classify the repository based on this information.
```
classify_repo(1)
