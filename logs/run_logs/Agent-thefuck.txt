------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (dir) thefuck
- (file) .editorconfig
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE.md
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) README.md
- (file) example.gif
- (file) example_instant_mode.gif
- (file) fastentrypoints.py
- (file) install.sh
- (file) release.py
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) setup.cfg
- (file) setup.py
- (file) snapcraft.yaml
- (file) tox.ini
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a `requirements.txt` file suggests that the project may be installable via that method, although the existence of a `setup.py` file indicates that it might also be installable using setuptools. To confirm the installation method, I will first check the contents of the README file and then inspect the presence of the necessary files to categorize the repository.
I will begin by checking the presence of the README file and the requirements.txt file.
- `check_presence("README.md")`
- `check_presence("requirements.txt")`

The presence of the README file confirms that there is documentation available for the project. To determine the installation method, I will check the contents of the README file for any specific installation instructions or references to installation methods. I will proceed by examining the README file.
- `read_file("README.md")`

The README file contains a section on "Installation," indicating that there are likely specific installation instructions provided. I will inspect the "Installation" section to determine the recommended method for installing the project. This will help me determine the appropriate installation method for the repository.
- `inspect_header("README.md", "Installation")`

The "Installation" section of the README file provides specific instructions for installing the project using package managers such as Homebrew, apt, pacman, and pip. There are also recommendations for manual installation. This indicates that the project does not have a specific requirements.txt file for installation, and there is no mention of a poetry.lock file, suggesting that a Dockerfile solely for installation is not present. Therefore, it is likely that the project should be installed using the provided installation instructions.
I will proceed with classifying the repository.
