------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (dir) thefuck
- (file) .editorconfig
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE.md
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) README.md
- (file) example.gif
- (file) example_instant_mode.gif
- (file) fastentrypoints.py
- (file) install.sh
- (file) release.py
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) setup.cfg
- (file) setup.py
- (file) snapcraft.yaml
- (file) tox.ini
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a `requirements.txt` file suggests that the project might use this file for dependencies installation. Before making a final determination, I will inspect the README for any explicit installation instructions.

I will start by examining the README file to see if there are any installation instructions provided there.
