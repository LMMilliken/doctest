------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (dir) thefuck
- (file) .editorconfig
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE.md
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) README.md
- (file) example.gif
- (file) example_instant_mode.gif
- (file) fastentrypoints.py
- (file) install.sh
- (file) release.py
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) setup.cfg
- (file) setup.py
- (file) snapcraft.yaml
- (file) tox.ini
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Based on the presence of the `requirements.txt` file, it is likely that the installation can be done via a requirements file, but I should confirm by checking the README for installation instructions.

Next, I will read the README.md file to look for any installation instructions.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The `README.md` file contains a detailed table of contents, indicating sections on installation, requirements, updating, and more. This structure suggests that there might be specific installation instructions under these sections.

Next, I will inspect the "Installation" section of the `README.md` file to confirm the installation method.

The installation instructions suggest various methods, including using `pip`, which implies the presence of necessary Python dependencies that might be listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Based on this, the most widely applicable guess is to classify the repo as one requiring installation via a requirements.txt file.

I am now ready to classify the repo.
