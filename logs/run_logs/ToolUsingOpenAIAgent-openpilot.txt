------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) .vscode
- (dir) cereal
- (dir) common
- (dir) docs
- (dir) openpilot
- (symlink) rednose
- (dir) release
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) selfdrive
- (dir) site_scons
- (dir) system
- (symlink) teleoprtc
- (dir) third_party
- (symlink) tinygrad
- (dir) tools
- (file) .clang-tidy
- (file) .dockerignore
- (file) .editorconfig
- (file) .gitattributes
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .gitmodules
- (file) .lfsconfig
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) .python-version
- (file) Dockerfile.openpilot
- (file) Dockerfile.openpilot_base
- (file) Jenkinsfile
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) RELEASES.md
- (file) SConstruct
- (file) SECURITY.md
- (file) body
- (file) codecov.yml
- (file) conftest.py
- (file) launch_chffrplus.sh
- (file) launch_env.sh
- (file) launch_openpilot.sh
- (file) msgq
- (file) opendbc
- (file) panda
- (file) poetry.lock
- (file) rednose_repo
- (file) teleoprtc_repo
- (file) tinygrad_repo
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The presence of a `poetry.lock` file suggests that the project may use Poetry for dependency management, and the absence of a `requirements.txt` file indicates that a `poetry.lock` file is likely to be used for installation. 

Next, I'd like to check the presence of a `README.md` file to confirm if there are any specific installation instructions mentioned there. I will also check if there's a `pyproject.toml` file to further confirm the use of Poetry.

What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of [supported car makes, models, and model years](docs/CARS.md). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera-based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration](docs/INTEGRATION.md) and [limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).

To start using openpilot in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things:
1. **Supported Device:** a comma 3/3X, available at [comma.ai/shop](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).
2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma 3/3X allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` to install the release version.
3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 250+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md).
4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your comma 3/3X to your car.

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup). Note that it's possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it's not plug-and-play.

To start developing openpilot
------

openpilot is developed by [comma](https://comma.ai/) and by users like you. We welcome both pull requests and issues on [GitHub](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot).

* Join the [community Discord](https://discord.comma.ai)
* Check out [the contributing docs](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* Check out the [openpilot tools](tools/)
* Read about the [development workflow](docs/WORKFLOW.md)
* Code documentation lives at https://docs.comma.ai
* Information about running openpilot lives on the [community wiki](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki)

Want to get paid to work on openpilot? [comma is hiring](https://comma.ai/jobs#open-positions) and offers lots of [bounties](docs/BOUNTIES.md) for external contributors.

Safety and Testing
----

* openpilot observes [ISO26262](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262) guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md) for more details.
* openpilot has software-in-the-loop [tests](.github/workflows/selfdrive_tests.yaml) that run on every commit.
* The code enforcing the safety model lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.
* panda has software-in-the-loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).
* Internally, we have a hardware-in-the-loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware-in-the-loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).
* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 comma devices continuously replaying routes.

User Data and comma Account
------

By default, openpilot uploads the driving data to our servers. You can also access your data through [comma connect](https://connect.comma.ai/). We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.

openpilot is open source software: the user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.

openpilot logs the road-facing cameras, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver-facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.

By using openpilot, you agree to [our Privacy Policy](https://comma.ai/privacy). You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma for the use of this data.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The README.md file provides detailed information about the openpilot project, including its functionalities, vehicle integration, development resources, safety and testing aspects, user data, licensing, and disclaimer. However, it does not explicitly mention the installation method or dependencies needed for the project. Therefore, based on the presence of a `poetry.lock` file and no mention of installation instructions, it's likely that the project uses Poetry for dependency management, and a `poetry.lock` file is present for installation. 

Next, I will inspect the contents of the repository to confirm the presence of a `pyproject.toml` file, which is typically used with Poetry, and then proceed with the `classify_repo` command.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The presence of a `poetry.lock` file alongside other repository files suggests that the project uses Poetry for dependency management, supporting the initial indication. This indicates a high likelihood that the project's dependencies should be installed using the `poetry install` command. Based on this information, it can be classified as a repository that contains a `poetry.lock` file for installation.

I will now proceed with the `classify_repo` command.
