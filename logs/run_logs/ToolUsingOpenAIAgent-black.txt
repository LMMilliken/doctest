------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) action
- (dir) autoload
- (dir) docs
- (dir) gallery
- (dir) plugin
- (dir) profiling
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) src
- (dir) tests
- (file) .flake8
- (file) .git_archival.txt
- (file) .gitattributes
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) .pre-commit-hooks.yaml
- (file) .prettierrc.yaml
- (file) .readthedocs.yaml
- (file) AUTHORS.md
- (file) CHANGES.md
- (file) CITATION.cff
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) README.md
- (file) SECURITY.md
- (file) action.yml
- (file) test_requirements.txt
- (file) tox.ini
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

The repo contains a Dockerfile, which indicates that the project may require specific installation steps or dependencies to run in a Docker environment. There is also a test_requirements.txt file, suggesting that the project may have dependencies that need to be installed.

I will start by checking the presence of a requirements.txt file, a poetry.lock file, and any specific installation instructions in the README file to understand the installation method required for this project.

here are the contents of README.md'sInstallation section:
"

_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.8+ to run.
If you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install "black[jupyter]"`.

If you can't wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:

`pip install git+https://github.com/psf/black`

"

Based on the information in the README file, the installation method for the project involves using pip to install the _Black_ package. The project does not appear to have any specific dependencies or a poetry.lock file. Additionally, there are no specific installation instructions other than using pip to install _Black_.

I am now certain that the appropriate installation method for this project is [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed. Therefore, I will use the `classify_repo` command to confirm this assessment.
