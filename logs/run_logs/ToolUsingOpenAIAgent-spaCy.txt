------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .github
- (dir) bin
- (dir) examples
- (dir) extra
- (dir) licenses
- (dir) spacy
- (dir) website
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) CITATION.cff
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) Makefile
- (file) README.md
- (file) build-constraints.txt
- (file) netlify.toml
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) setup.cfg
- (file) setup.py
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a `requirements.txt` file suggests that the project might be installable via a requirements file. Additionally, the presence of a `setup.py` file indicates that the project might be installable using a setup script. I will inspect the contents of the `README.md` file to confirm the installation instructions and then use the `check_presence` function to validate my assumptions.

I will start by inspecting the README and checking for the presence of any installation instructions.

The README contains clear installation instructions using pip and also mentions the option to compile from source. These instructions indicate that the project is likely installable via a requirements file or a setup script, depending on the specific details mentioned in the installation section. I will now use the `check_presence` function to confirm the presence of specific files like `requirements.txt`, `poetry.lock`, and others to determine the appropriate installation method.

I will proceed to check for the presence of specific files to determine the installation method.

The presence of the `requirements.txt` file confirms that the project can be installed via a requirements file. Therefore, I would use Installation via a requirements.txt file for this project. I am now confident in my answer and will use the `classify_repo` command.
