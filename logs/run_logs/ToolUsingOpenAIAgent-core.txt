------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) .vscode
- (dir) homeassistant
- (dir) machine
- (dir) pylint
- (dir) rootfs
- (dir) script
- (dir) tests
- (file) .core_files.yaml
- (file) .coveragerc
- (file) .dockerignore
- (file) .git-blame-ignore-revs
- (file) .gitattributes
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) .hadolint.yaml
- (file) .pre-commit-config.yaml
- (file) .prettierignore
- (file) .strict-typing
- (file) .yamllint
- (file) CLA.md
- (file) CODEOWNERS
- (file) CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) Dockerfile
- (file) Dockerfile.dev
- (file) LICENSE.md
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) README.rst
- (file) build.yaml
- (file) codecov.yml
- (file) mypy.ini
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) requirements_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test.txt
- (file) requirements_test_all.txt
- (file) requirements_test_pre_commit.txt
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

The presence of a `requirements.txt` file suggests that the project may be using the standard Python package management approach. However, to be sure, I will check the README or any other relevant files for installation instructions.
I will start by checking the presence of a requirements.txt file and then inspect the README file for any installation instructions.

The presence of a `requirements.txt` file indicates that the project may be using the standard Python package management approach. To confirm, I will inspect the README file for any installation instructions and to verify if there are any specific dependencies mentioned.
I will begin by reviewing the README file to identify any installation instructions and to confirm the presence of specific dependencies. Then, I will use the information to determine the appropriate installation method.

The README file does not appear to have a clear section related to installation instructions or dependencies. Since the README did not provide clear guidance, I will check for the presence of a `poetry.lock` file or any other indication of the project's dependency management approach.
I will proceed by checking for the presence of a `poetry.lock` file to determine the dependency management approach and then use this information to ascertain the appropriate installation method.

Given the absence of a `poetry.lock` file and the presence of a `requirements.txt` file, it is likely that the project uses the standard Python package management approach, indicating that installation via a `requirements.txt` file may be the appropriate method. I will use this information to classify the repository.
