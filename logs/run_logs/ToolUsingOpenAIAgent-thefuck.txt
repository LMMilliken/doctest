------------------
I want to work on the following python project, inside of a docker container.
Your task is to determine what type of installation method I should use,
 - [1] Installation via a requirements.txt file
 - [2] Has no dependencies, no installation script needed
 - [3] Contains a poetry.lock file
 - [4] Contains a Dockerfile solely for installation, not deployment

Here is the contents of the repo's root directory (`.`):
- (dir) .devcontainer
- (dir) .github
- (dir) scripts
- (dir) tests
- (dir) thefuck
- (file) .editorconfig
- (file) .gitignore
- (file) CONTRIBUTING.md
- (file) LICENSE.md
- (file) MANIFEST.in
- (file) README.md
- (file) example.gif
- (file) example_instant_mode.gif
- (file) fastentrypoints.py
- (file) install.sh
- (file) release.py
- (file) requirements.txt
- (file) setup.cfg
- (file) setup.py
- (file) snapcraft.yaml
- (file) tox.ini
Start by inspecting the README and looking for any installation instructions there. Do not assume the presence of any files, use the `check_presence` function to confirm any assumptions you make.

In one or two sentences, give your thoughts about the provided information, then describe what you would like to do next.
You can use provided tools to retrieve additional information about the repo's contents.
Once you are certain of your answer, use the `classify_repo` command.
Always use one of these commands in your response, if the repo could be one of multiple categories, give the most widely applicable guess.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The presence of a requirements.txt file suggests that the project may use this file for installation. However, since the project contains a setup.py file and a poetry.lock file, further inspection is necessary to determine the most appropriate installation method. I will start by checking the presence of these files to make an accurate determination. After that, I will examine the README for any installation instructions.
To continue, I will check for the presence of a requirements.txt file.

The presence of the requirements.txt file indicates that the project may use this file for installation. However, the existence of setup.py and poetry.lock files may suggest alternative installation methods. To further clarify, I will inspect the README for any installation instructions and review the contents of the setup.py file.
To proceed, I will gather more information by examining the README file and the content of the setup.py file.

The README.md file contains an "Installation" section, which is relevant for determining the appropriate installation method. I will inspect the content of the "Installation" section to identify the specific installation instructions provided. This will allow me to make an accurate determination of the installation method.
To proceed, I will retrieve the content of the "Installation" section in the README file.

The "Installation" section of the README file provides specific installation instructions for various operating systems, predominantly using package managers or the pip command. Based on this information, and the presence of a requirements.txt file, it is likely that the project can be installed via a requirements.txt file or by using the pip command. Therefore, I will classify the repository as "Installation via a requirements.txt file."
To proceed, I will use the `classify_repo` command to finalize the classification.
